v</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Author&rsquo;s object in
offering to the Public the following pages is, that all who have
a desire to examine the beauties of Welsh scenery may also have
an opportunity of seeing the most <i>interesting</i> portion of
it in a tour which will not occupy more than a month.&nbsp; The
route described in this volume presents a variety of pictures
which can scarcely be equalled, and certainly not surpassed, in
any quarter of the globe.&nbsp; It is true there are hills higher
far than any in Snowdonia, and valleys more extensive; but, while
we are astonished at a description of the enormous magnitude of
the Asiatic and American mountains, and the noble rivers, and
sea-like lakes of the latter, let us take into our consideration
which is the most desirable country to explore; that in which
nature&rsquo;s prodigies are so extensive that we can neither
ascend the eminences, ford the rivers, nor view the opposite
shores of the extensive lakes; or <i>that</i> where mountains may
be scaled with ease, from the summits of which a series of
glorious panoramas burst upon the eye,&mdash;wherein the valleys,
glens, and wild ravines present an endless variety of sublimity
and beauty, and the loud torrent and the waterfall pour forth
their melody of never-tiring sweetness, to delight the ear?</p>
<p>Seas must be crossed, and miles of dreary and uninteresting
country traversed, in wandering from one grand object to another
in the <i>former</i>; while, in the route here represented to the
Public&mdash;within the reach of all&mdash;repose and admiration
charm the heart by turns, in the rich fertile valleys, lofty and
wood-clad hills, or heather-mantled mountains, of North
Wales.&nbsp; The traveller is likewise insured the comfort of a
good inn, where he may rest his wearied limbs after a day&rsquo;s
ramble in whatever part of the district he chooses to select for
his excursion; and the healthy and active should decidedly make
<i>use</i> of <a name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
vi</span>their <i>limbs</i>, to bear them through this tour, in
preference to the more easy and luxurious vehicle, and even to
the equestrian mode of conveyance.&nbsp; A good horsewoman may
venture into the dark defiles, or climb the craggy heights upon
the ponies, which are always in readiness at the inns for that
purpose; but between a man and his steed there will most
assuredly be a strong feeling of sympathy created by a conviction
that the one is a most unnecessary burthen to the other.</p>
<p>The peasantry are simple, honest, and obliging; and, as they
trudge along, a spirit of freedom sparkles in their eyes, and
seems to animate every action of their unfettered limbs.&nbsp;
Though their fare is humble, they enjoy it with an appetite to
which the bracing air of their hills, and their happy ignorance
of luxuries, gives an enviable zest.&nbsp; Drunkenness is a vice
almost unknown among these primitive mountaineers: milk is their
common beverage, oatmeal cakes, and potatoes, with a plentiful
supply of trout from their native streams, form their chief
summer food; while, in winter, dry salted beef and mutton serve
to satisfy their utmost wishes.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Though poor the peasant&rsquo;s hut, his
feasts tho&rsquo; small,<br />
He sees his little lot the lot of all.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * *</p>
<p>Dear is that shed to which his soul conforms,<br />
And dear that hill which lifts him to the storms.<br />
And, as a child, when scaring sounds molest,<br />
Clings close and closer to the mother&rsquo;s breast,<br />
So the loud torrent, and the whirlwind&rsquo;s roar,<br />
But bind him to his native mountains more.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

vii</span>DIRECTIONS<br />
<span class="GutSmall">TO THOSE UNACQUAINTED WITH THE WELSH
LANGUAGE.</span></h2>
<p>A knowledge of the Welsh alphabet is indispensable to those
who are desirous of correctly pronouncing the necessary questions
and answers that transpire upon the road.&nbsp; The names of
places must effectually puzzle any tourist, who is not acquainted
with the peculiar sound of each letter particularly where there
are many consonants in a word.&nbsp; In order, therefore, to aid
the traveller in Wales, I have selected the following rules.</p>
<p>In the Welsh alphabet there are no mutes; and all letters that
are circumflex must be pronounced long, as</p>
<p class="gutlist">B&ocirc;n like the English bone.</p>
<p class="gutlist">Bin, as been.</p>
<p class="gutlist">C, always as K in English.</p>
<p class="gutlist">Ch, is pronounced as the Greek
<i>&Chi;</i>.</p>
<p class="gutlist">Dd, as the English th in this, that, thou.</p>
<p class="gutlist">F, as V in English.</p>
<p class="gutlist">Ff as F and double F in English.</p>
<p class="gutlist">G, as G in good, but never soft as in
genial.</p>
<p class="gutlist">I, as I in king, but never as in fire.</p>
<p class="gutlist">Ll, as L aspirated.</p>
<p class="gutlist">Th, as in thought.</p>
<p class="gutlist">U, as I in the English words bliss, kiss,
&amp;c.</p>
<p class="gutlist">W, as double O in good, wood.</p>
<p class="gutlist"><a name="pageviii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. viii</span>Y, as U in burn; but in the last
syllable of a word, and in all monosyllables except Y, Ydd, Ym,
Yn, Yr, Ys, Fy, Dy, Myn, it is like I in Sin.</p>
<p>By attending to these rules, the stranger will easily make
himself understood by the peasantry, and on his tours, in
enquiring for any place to which he may be journeying.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Various</span>, as the features of human
nature, are the sources of human happiness.&nbsp; Some derive
their choicest pleasure from historical accounts of men who lived
in by-gone ages, and in re-creating events that have long since
been engulphed in the abyss of time,&mdash;breaking down the
barrier of intervening years, and mingling, in idea, with those
who were once deemed the glorious of the earth, who now lie
blended with its grossest atoms, or are confounded with the purer
elements.&nbsp; Some, parching with the thirst of knowledge, seek
to slake the fever of their minds with most <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>laborious
research; explore the utmost regions of the globe to find a
shorter marine passage; or pierce into its depths to seek for
treasures which only exist in their heated fancies.&nbsp; The
vast ocean is fathomed to satisfy the ruling principle of their
natures,&mdash;curiosity; and the realms of air traversed with
the same motive to insure the universally desired result,
self-gratification.&nbsp; While some, leaving the elements to
perform the destined changes, are willing to agree with the poet,
who in the warmth of his philanthropy exclaims:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The proper study of mankind is
man;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and among this class of beings the author of these pages may
be ranked, although he willingly confesses nature has the power
of charming him in her most minute as in her most stupendous
works, from the curious and confined instinct of the ant and of
the bee to the wonderful and exhaustless energies of the human
mind,</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That
source<br />
Whence learning, virtue, wisdom, all things flow.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The court, the city, and the country, present an endless
variety of subjects for contemplation; and the latter being the
region of delight to those whose business confines them to the
metropolis for the winter months, the author of this volume is
anxious to be thought a useful and amusing companion to such
tourists who, in pursuit of health and the charms of nature, may
wander</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In the Welsh vales &rsquo;mid mountains
high.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where the sublime and beautiful present themselves <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>at every turn
to captivate the eye, and ruddy health colours the smiling faces
of every peasant girl and shepherd boy, from Chirk to
Holyhead.</p>
<p>To a mind capable of estimating fine scenery, how delightful
are the hurry and bustle which usually take place on the morning
of departure, in fond expectation of realizing the anticipated
pleasure of viewing those beauties of nature the imagination has
but weakly painted!&nbsp; The sun is scarcely sooner up than the
traveller; and, although, perhaps, it is yet three hours to the
time of departure, his anxiety preponderates over the now
slighted comforts of his bed of down, and with an agile leap he
quits his restless pillow, and hastily despatching the business
of his toilet, with his heart beating high, and his knapsack
already stuffed with three shirts, as many pairs of stockings,
guide books, and as few other necessaries as may be, in order to
make his walking wardrobe as light as possible, he prepares to
take the road.&nbsp; If a disciple of old Izaac Walton and
Cotton, he will not fail to have his book of flies, lines, reels,
&amp;c., and a light fly-rod to carry in his hand, and for which
he is sure to have use whenever he feels inclined for piscatory
pastime on his tour.&nbsp; So stocked and provided, he bids
defiance to the evils of life; and may exclaim with the poet</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Warly cares and warly men<br />
May a&rsquo; gae tapsalteeree O!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The cab is at the door, Sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>&ldquo;Is everything I want put into it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, good-bye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, my man, drive to Euston-square Station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Sir.&rdquo;&nbsp; And away we went,</p>
<p>What a scene of bustle and confusion a metropolitan railway
station presents a few minutes before the starting of a train,
and more especially in holiday time.&nbsp; Men, women, and
children, in every direction, hurriedly traversing the crowded
platform; luggage barrows, with porters, rushing to and fro;
newspaper venders bawling &ldquo;<i>Times</i>!&nbsp;
<i>Chronicle</i>!&nbsp; <i>Punch</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; Cabs galloping
into the yard with anxious passengers; others, after having
deposited their living burthens, slowly quitting it; the crowd of
persons pressing forward for their tickets, jamming and jostling
each other, as if the existence of each individual depended upon
his or her obtaining that necessary passport.&nbsp; At length all
are supplied and seated in their various carriages.&nbsp; Phiz!
goes the steam, and the train slowly and majestically quits the
station, gathering fresh speed in its progress, until the
travellers find themselves whirled along at the rate of thirty or
forty miles an hour; station after station appear and disappear
like the lightning flash of a summer&rsquo;s cloud&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A moment bright, then lost for
ever,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and in the short space of a few hours the journey to
Shrewsbury is accomplished.</p>
<h3><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>BATTLEFIELD.</h3>
<p>Within two miles of Shrewsbury, and nearly the same distance
from the railway, upon the right of the line, the traveller will
behold Battlefield Church, built by Henry the Fourth to
commemorate the celebrated Battle of Shrewsbury, which, like that
of Bosworth, has been immortalised by the magic pen of
Shakspere.&nbsp; Who cannot call to remembrance the gallant and
fiery Hotspur, or the future Hero of
Agincourt?&mdash;&ldquo;Young Harry with his beaver
on,&rdquo;&mdash;and last, not least, fat Jack Falstaff, his
humourous catechism upon &ldquo;Honour;&rdquo; with whom
discretion was the better part of valour, notwithstanding his
&ldquo;long hour&rsquo;s fight by Shrewsbury clock?&rdquo;&nbsp;
Here, covered with wounds, the ambitious Hotspur fell, and his
dead body, which had been buried on the field, was unearthed, and
barbarously bruised between two millstones, and afterwards
beheaded and quartered.</p>
<h3>SHREWSBURY.</h3>
<p>The old town of Shrewsbury contains many objects of
considerable interest and historical association, which will
afford to the antiquary or the curious abundant gratification for
the few hours he may devote to them.&nbsp; Those to which the
traveller should in particular direct his attention are the
Castle, the Abbey, and St. Giles&rsquo;s Church; the two former
were built by the first Norman Earl of Shrewsbury, Roger de
Montgomery.</p>
<p>The town is beautifully situated on the Severn, on a <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>peninsula
made by the bend of the river; and, standing upon gentle
eminences, it presents a bold and commanding appearance.&nbsp;
Upon the west side of the town, stretching along upon the banks
of the river, and over-arched with magnificent lime trees, is a
most delightful promenade&mdash;called the Quarry.</p>
<p>Having stayed the night in Shrewsbury, the following morning I
once more placed myself in a railway carriage for a short ride
upon the line to Chirk, at which place I had made up my mind to
commence my pedestrian tour.&nbsp; I think it necessary, however,
to impress upon the minds of tourists that the Llangollen Road
Station (which is a mile beyond Chirk) is unquestionably the key
upon this side of the country to the very heart of the finest
scenery in Wales, and that from thence he can obtain public
conveyances which run daily to Capel Curig, Snowdon, Bala,
Barmouth, Dolgelley, and a hundred other enchanting places in the
Principality.</p>
<p>Arriving at Chirk Station, I, like the Honourable Dick Dowlas,
with my wardrobe on my back, and a light heart, proceeded on the
road to the village.&nbsp; Bees hummed, birds sang, and blossoms
sent forth their fragrance, to delight the traveller as he gaily
trudged &ldquo;the footpath way.&rdquo;&nbsp; Cheerfulness was
above, beneath, and around me, and in my heart.&nbsp; I had not
taken many paces when I was accosted by an elderly person, in a
straw hat, fustian shooting coat, knee breeches, gaiters, and
shoes, he had a stout cudgel in his hand, <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>and knapsack
more capacious than mine strapped over his shoulders.&nbsp; He
appeared to be about fifty-five years of age, and being furnished
like myself, it struck me that a passing traveller might
naturally take us for father and son.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we were pursuing the same route, and a desultory
dialogue commenced with the never-failing observation&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fine morning, Sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A great admirer of the charms of nature, I
presume?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An enthusiastic one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re for the Welsh vales, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And mountains high,&rdquo; I exclaimed, warming to my
loquacious companion&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In the Welsh vales &rsquo;mid mountains
high,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>sang he, in a round-toned voice, with which I chimed in, and
we were the best friends on a sudden.</p>
<p>There certainly is no society so interesting as that picked up
by the tourist, who leaves with contempt the starched formalities
of a great city behind him, and walks forth unencumbered by care,
to enjoy the society of mankind in its varied and unsophisticated
nature.&nbsp; Every person we meet affords us information and
delight; for a kindred spirit animates almost every individual
whom you may chance to encounter in countries remarkable for
beauties of scenery, and especially in a region like North Wales,
where inns of the best <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>kind are situated at the most
convenient points, and the foot passenger is treated with as much
respect as a lord in his carriage.&nbsp; The landlords of inns
here think that a man may make the proper use of his legs without
being a beggar; and that the costume of a pedestrian may cover
the form of a gentleman.&nbsp; This philanthropic conception
contributes to form that happy combination, civil hosts and merry
travellers.</p>
<p>There is no want of society, nor any difficulty in selecting
that with which you are best pleased; for every evening brings in
fresh comers from various quarters to the different places of
rest and refreshment.&nbsp; The exchange of information
respecting routes, the different adventures of the day, the
peculiar feelings displayed in their recital, and countenances
lit up with pleasure, give a degree of animation to the evening,
never to be equalled in the brilliant drawing-room, the blaze of
which seems to put out the eyes of reason,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And men are&mdash;what they name not to
themselves<br />
And trust not to each other.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>THE VILLAGE OF CHIRK</h3>
<p>is agreeably situated upon the northern bank of the river
Ceiriog, which divides England from Wales.&nbsp; The village
church is dedicated to St. Mary, and is an impropriation
belonging to Valle Crucis Abbey, and contains some monuments
erected to the memories of the Chirk families.&nbsp; The most
interesting is that of the famous Sir Thomas Myddelton.&nbsp; In
the churchyard are some fine aged yew trees.</p>
<h3><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>BRYNKINALT.</h3>
<p>Taking the road upon the left of the church, we entered the
charming park of Brynkinalt, and visited one of the most
picturesque seats in the Principality.&nbsp; This elegant
mansion, with its ivy-covered walls, is the principal residence
of the Viscount Dungannon, who is descended from Tudor Trevor,
Earl of Hereford, founder of one of the fifteen tribes of North
Wales.&nbsp; Valle Crucis Abbey, as well as many of the churches
in the neighbourhood, have been greatly improved at his
lordship&rsquo;s expense, who is distinguished for
arch&aelig;ological taste and research.&nbsp; The house was built
during the reign of James the First, from a design by Inigo
Jones, and is delightfully situated upon the brow of a hill, from
which circumstance it derives its name.&nbsp; The park is divided
by the river Ceiriog.</p>
<p>The late Duke of Wellington was maternally descended from this
house.&nbsp; His mother, the Countess of Mornington, who was a
daughter of Arthur Hill-Trevor, first Viscount Dungannon, spent
much of her time here during the boyhood of our illustrious hero,
who frequently visited his noble parent during the Eton
holidays.&nbsp; There are yet living those who remember the
boyish frolics of him who was at a later period destined to act
so conspicuous a part in the world&rsquo;s history.</p>
<p>By permission of the noble proprietor, the house and grounds
are accessible to strangers during the summer months, and the
paintings by Claude, Titian, Salvator <a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>Rosa, Carravaggio, Zucharelli,
&amp;c., are well worthy the inspection of the connoisseur and
artist.</p>
<h3>CHIRK CASTLE.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;In Cambria&rsquo;s noon
of story,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ere bright she set in glory,<br />
The brave and great, in princely state,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All hail&rsquo;d Chirk Castle
walls.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With splendid arms returning,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The flaring torches burning,<br />
&rsquo;Mid armour&rsquo;s clang the clarions rang,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And search&rsquo;d the sounding halls.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="GutSmall">SONG BY F. M.
DOVASTON, A.M.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chirk Castle is delightfully situated on the spacious domain,
spreading over the summit of, what would be deemed, by a
southern, a lofty mountain, but which is here only designated a
hill, projecting from the range of the Berwyn Mountains, and is
well calculated to recall the stories of the days of old, when
flourished&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The good old rule, the
simple plan,<br />
That they should take who have the power,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And they should keep who can.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is built of solid stone; and the ivy, mantling over the
walls, gives them an appearance of solemnity and grandeur
peculiarly interesting.&nbsp; It is quadrangular, and is
strengthened by five massive towers, one at each corner, and the
fifth projecting from the principal front, through which is a
lofty entrance into the court-yard, 165 feet in length, and 100
feet in breadth, surrounded on every side by noble suites of
apartments.&nbsp; The picture gallery measures 100 feet in
length, by twenty-two in breadth, and contains some very
excellent paintings, and several portraits of the Myddelton
family.&nbsp; Amongst the latter is that of Sir Thomas Myddelton,
<a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>who
defended himself gallantly against the forces of Cromwell.&nbsp;
He was rewarded for his loyalty by Charles the Second, who
granted him &pound;30,000 for the loss he had sustained, besides
many valuable presents; amongst others, a cabinet, which is shewn
in the gallery, valued at &pound;7000, richly ornamented with
silver; in various compartments of which are paintings, said to
have been executed by Rubens.&nbsp; The monarch offered to
elevate Sir Thomas to the peerage, which he declined.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p26b.jpg">
<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>The walls of the castle are eighteen feet in thickness; but
sleeping and other apartments have been cut into them, for the
accommodation of the family.</p>
<p>The celebrated picture of Pistyll Rhaiadr, in the dining-room,
shows that noble waterfall tumbling into the <i>sea</i>, <i>where
several ships are quietly riding at anchor</i>.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Pistyll Rhaiadr,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> &ldquo;The Spout of
the Cataract,&rdquo; is considered the largest fall in
Wales.&nbsp; In the valley of Mochnant, about four miles from
Llanrhaiadr, the river falls over an almost perpendicular rock,
240 feet high; thence rushing furiously under a natural arch
towards the bottom, it plunges into a deep black pool, overhung
with impervious shaggy wood.</p>
<p>The story of the artist&rsquo;s introducing the ocean, with
ships, is rather curious.&nbsp; He was a foreigner, and but
little acquainted with the English language; and when he had
completed the picture, one of the persons to whom it was first
shown observed, that &ldquo;a few <i>sheep</i> placed near the
foot of the fall would be a great improvement.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Misunderstanding <i>sheep</i> for <i>ship</i>, his <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>amazement was
extreme.&nbsp; He, however, took the picture to his easel, and
introduced <i>ships</i>, with the necessary element to float
them!&nbsp; A mistake so humourous determined the purchaser to
allow of no further alteration.</p>
<p>The present building was completed in two years.&nbsp; The
first stone being laid in the year 1011, and in 1013 the castle
frowned defiance to the foe.</p>
<p>It was built by Roger Mortimer, Earl of Wigmore, as a
stronghold to defend him from the just vengeance he had created
by the murder of the sons of Gruffydd ab Madoc, to whom he was
appointed guardian, in conjunction with John, Earl of Warren, in
the hope of inheriting their joint estates.&nbsp; Mortimer was to
seize upon Nanheudwy and Chirk, the property of the youngest; and
Warren upon the lands of Bromfield, Yale, and Dinas Bran,
belonging to the eldest.&nbsp; Travellers should not neglect to
visit this noble specimen of warlike architecture.&nbsp; Its
picture gallery and dungeon will, in their different styles,
excite admiration.</p>
<p>On the foundation of the present castle anciently stood Castle
Crogen; and the territory around bore the name of Trev-y Waun,
the property of the lords of Dinas Bran, which continued in their
possession up to the death of Gruffydd ab Madoc, in the reign of
Edward the First.</p>
<p>The view from the highlands of the park is very extensive, and
commands a prospect of seventeen different counties.</p>
<p><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>The
vale beneath, which winds along the foot of the vast Berwyn
Mountains, was the scene of a desperate conflict between Henry
the Second and the Welsh.&nbsp; Henry having determined once more
to attempt the subjugation of Wales, and to revenge the ravages
carried through the borders by its gallant prince, Owen Gwynedd,
assembled a vast army at Oswestry.&nbsp; Owen, on the contrary,
collected all the chieftains and their dependents at
Corwen.&nbsp; The two armies met on the banks of the
Ceiriog.&nbsp; The conflict was obstinate and bloody, and numbers
of brave men perished.&nbsp; In the end the Welsh retired to
Corwen.&nbsp; Henry reached the summit of the Berwyn, but was so
distressed by dreadful rains, and by the activity and prudence of
Owen, who cut him off from all supplies, that he was obliged to
return ingloriously, with considerable loss of men and
equipage.&nbsp; The place is still called <i>Adwy&rsquo;r
Beddau</i>, or the Pass of the Graves&mdash;of the men who were
slain there.</p>
<p>The remains of Offa&rsquo;s Dyke, the ancient boundary between
England and Wales, are still visible near the castle, and may be
traced a considerable distance through the park.</p>
<p>The Vale of the Ceiriog at Chirk, like that of the Dee between
Chirk and Llangollen, is distinguished by two specimens of
architectural skill and enterprise, each valley being crossed by
the Ellesmere Canal and the Shrewsbury and Chester Railway, upon
long ranges of arches, at a considerable elevation.</p>
<p><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>The
aqueducts of Chirk and Pont y Cysylltau have long been the
objects of general admiration, but for elegance of design, as
well as magnitude, they must now yield the palm to the viaducts
of the railway, which are, in truth, most noble structures.</p>
<p>In this lovely village we put up at the Chirk Castle Arms to
take luncheon, which was served with much civility&mdash;cold
meat, a cream salad, and a capital Cheshire cheese, with the best
of Shropshire ale.&nbsp; This excellent inn is kept by Mr.
Moses.</p>
<p>After proceeding about a mile and a half on the Llangollen
Road, and leaving Wynnstay, the noble mansion of Sir Watkin
Williams Wynn, Bart., M.P., on the right, we were conducted along
the banks of a beautiful canal (the same that crosses the valley
at Chirk), which was here planted with laurel and hazel in
pleasing variety on either side.&nbsp; On a sudden, an opening in
the foliage presented us with a splendid view of the Vale of the
Dee, with the two noble structures, the viaduct and aqueduct,
gracefully stretching from hill to hill, and the waters of the
river making their way amongst the broken rocks and embowering
trees, and rolling under their arches with that delightful sound
which is only heard in mountain scenery.</p>
<p>Seldom had I experienced so delightful a sensation as the
present prospect occasioned.&nbsp; All was so calm, so quiet, it
seemed, indeed, &ldquo;the Happy Valley.&rdquo;&nbsp; Shortly
after, however, we found that no golden pleasure is entirely free
from alloy, for on turning a projection <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>upon the
road, we were nearly stifled from a lime furnace, and what was
worse, another and another still succeeded, resembling a line of
batteries blazing and vomiting forth smoke and destruction, while
upon the opposite mountain an uniform body of iron works were
firing away from their tall chimneys, and steadily maintained the
never-ceasing conflict.</p>
<p>At length, however, having happily passed these belligerents,
my companion led me in triumph into a little public house on the
road side, which overlooked a precipice, the <i>Aqueduct
Tavern</i>, the exterior of which promised little better
accommodation than is met with in an Irish cabin.&nbsp; We
entered, nevertheless, and although the floor was of brick, it
was very clean, and the household utensils glittered along the
walls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray, gentlemen, walk into the back parlour,&rdquo;
said a comely-looking, good-natured landlady of forty-three.</p>
<p>We gladly accepted her invitation, and were agreeably
surprised to find a neat room, carpeted, with a sofa, and
half-a-dozen hair-bottomed chairs, and every thing rurally
comfortable.&nbsp; The window looked upon the aqueduct, and
commanded a beautiful prospect.</p>
<p>Having discussed our beverage, and lighted cigars, we quitted
the comfortable little cottage, and bent our steps towards the
aqueduct, to cross by it to the opposite side of the Vale.</p>
<p>A cigar in the cool of the evening is delightful,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Glorious tobacco, that from east to
west,<br />
Cheers the tar&rsquo;s labour, and the Turk-man&rsquo;s
rest.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>So sang
the noble bard, the music of whose lyre is left to charm the race
of mankind for ages yet to come.</p>
<p>We soon reached the centre of the aqueduct; it extends, from
hill to hill, in length 980 feet; it is sustained by twenty
piers, 115 feet in height from the bed of the river Dee, and the
span of the arches is forty-five feet.</p>
<p>The length of the viaduct is 1,538 feet; its height 147 feet,
the number of arches nineteen, and the span of each arch is sixty
feet.</p>
<p>I never felt the influence of the sublime mingled with the
beautiful so deeply as when I stood upon this wonderful work of
art; wherever I turned my eyes the scene was calculated to excite
the warmest feelings of admiration.&nbsp; The Dee flowing
beneath, shadowed by the rich tints of the summer foliage; the
ruined bridge; the dark mountain masses upon either side, patched
with gloomy pines, intermingled with the relieving brightness of
the graceful larch.&nbsp; Here waves the lovely blooming heather,
there stands the blasted rock in its naked majesty, the noble
amphitheatre at the extremity of the vale, with a distant view of
the viaduct; the twittering of the birds, as they settled to
repose upon the trees around, altogether gave a charm to the
evening which can only be felt while witnessing the scene, and
which exceeds the power of description.</p>
<p>Having crossed the aqueduct, we proceeded by the left bank of
the canal, passing a forge, that nearly stifled us with gaseous
smoke, along a pathway made of <a name="page33"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 33</span>cinders and small coal, the refuse of
the adjacent iron-smelting foundry.</p>
<p>Trees of every description hung over our heads, and sloped
down a deep declivity to the margin of the Dee, while on the
opposite bank the mountain frowned above us.&nbsp; The partial
glances we obtained of the vale through the woods, discovered
scenes which the artist&rsquo;s fancy might vainly attempt to
equal.</p>
<p>At length we reached the Bridge of Llangollen, whence the
river is seen to great advantage, tumbling over its rocky bed,
and rushing beneath the dark shelter of the over-hanging
trees.&nbsp; The village is small, and contains two respectable
hotels, viz., the Hand, at which we stopped by the advice of my
companion, and the Royal Hotel.</p>
<p>We were shown into a very good parlour, and after ordering a
tea and supper dinner, my friend, somewhat exhausted by the
day&rsquo;s march, flung himself upon a sofa, while I resumed my
journal, and soon afterwards retired to my bed-room, where the
murmurs of the flowing Dee were distinctly heard beneath the
window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here I am, then,&rdquo; said I, soliloquising, as I
pressed the pillow; &ldquo;here am I, at length, in the Vale of
Llangollen; in the village of Llangollen,&mdash;a spot which I
have so often longed to visit!&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Flow on, thou shining river!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and in a few moments I sank soundly to sleep.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I <span class="smcap">was</span> dreaming of home, and
happiness, and a thousand lovely things, when I was awakened by
my new acquaintance, who stood before me dressed for a sturdy
walk.&nbsp; &ldquo;A lovely morning,&rdquo; said my companion,
rubbing his hands with much delight; &ldquo;come, bustle, bustle,
my young friend; you are not in London, now.&nbsp; Permit me to
open the lattice; you will find no perfume at your chamber window
in town like this; and, as he spoke, he flung open the casement,
and a rush of fragrance poured into the room from hundreds of
roses that clustered upon the wall without; nor was my friend at
all deficient in praising its sweetness, for, taking a long
breath, he stood, for a moment, with his mouth wide open, and
then sent forth a sigh, long enough to form a bridge over the
river for the fairies to cross upon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we breakfast before we set out upon our
ramble?&nbsp; I think we had better give orders for it, <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>and visit the
cottage where Lady Eleanor Butler and Miss Ponsonby so long
resided, while it is preparing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This being agreed to, we gave directions for a breakfast, that
would enable us to undergo the subsequent fatigue with
cheerfulness, and then struck into the road for Plas
Newydd.&nbsp; This memorable little dwelling is pleasantly
situated upon a rising knoll, and commands a delightful prospect
of mountain scenery.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p35b.jpg">
<img alt=

 src="images/p35s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The front of the cottage is ornamented with an oaken palisade,
curiously carved with grotesque figures, giving a very tasty and
aristocratic appearance to the building.&nbsp; At the back of the
house is a neat grass plot, with a birdcote, where the robins
find a grateful shelter in the winter season, and where the
ladies fed them every morning.&nbsp; It is surrounded with a
fence of evergreens.&nbsp; From thence, the gardener conducted us
under an archway, to a very pleasant and winding path, which
leads to a well-stocked fruit garden.&nbsp; We then descended by
a shady walk, arched over with tall trees, to the primrose vale,
through which a refreshing stream rushes over rocks, where the
sun but rarely gilds it with its beams.&nbsp; It is a delightful
cool retreat, and well calculated to awaken the dormant spirit of
poesy, in any heart where it had ever deigned to dwell.&nbsp; We
passed over a rustic bridge which led us to the verandah, from
which we had a fine view of the valley, and the Pengwern and
Berwyn Mountains; and then proceeding a little farther up the
glen, we seated ourselves opposite a most picturesque font,
brought hither from the ruins <a name="page36"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>of Valle Crucis, by the late
proprietors of this spot.&nbsp; It is enclosed in a small arched
niche, and supplied with the purest water from a murmuring rill,
which falls in a thin stream into the bowl, a draught from which
is an exquisite treat&mdash;for <i>water</i> drinkers.</p>
<p>The flower garden is laid out with great taste, and the little
circular dairy, sunk in the ground, on the left at the front
entrance, gives a most pleasing and picturesque effect.&nbsp;
Altogether it is a place to which any person, wearied with the
bustle of society, would willingly fly for refuge, and find
repose.</p>
<p>Lady Eleanor Butler and Miss Ponsonby were young ladies of
beauty and rank, who loved each other with so true an affection
that they could never bear the afflicting idea of a separation
which the marriage of either might occasion.&nbsp; They,
therefore, resolved upon lives of celibacy, refusing many
handsome offers, and remaining deaf to the persuasions of their
friends, they retired to the beautiful Vale of Llangollen to
enjoy the happiness of each other&rsquo;s company, that as their
friendship began in infancy it might be perpetuated through
life.</p>
<p>These celebrated ladies were the pride of Llangollen for more
than half a century, and by their numerous charities and general
kindness of disposition, had endeared themselves to the hearts of
the whole neighbourhood.&nbsp; It is worthy of remark that during
the long period of their residence in Wales, they never, for a
single night slept from home.&nbsp; They occasionally <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>visited the
theatres at Wrexham and Oswestry, on charitable occasions, or
when a &ldquo;star&rdquo; was engaged; but their invariable
custom was to return home after the performances, whatever might
be the state of the weather.</p>
<p>In the lively Memoirs of the late Mr. Charles Matthews, the
celebrated comedian, is the following description of &ldquo;the
Ladies of Llangollen,&rdquo; but it must be remembered that at
that time</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Age, with stealing, stealing steps,<br />
Had clawed them in his clutch.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Oswestry</span>, Sept. 4, 1820.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dear inseparable inimitables, Lady Butler and Miss
Ponsonby were in the boxes here on Friday.&nbsp; They came twelve
miles from Llangollen, and returned, as they never sleep from
home.&nbsp; Oh! such curiosities!&nbsp; I was nearly
convulsed.&nbsp; I could scarcely get on for the first ten
minutes after my eye caught them.&nbsp; Though I had never seen
them, I instantly knew them.&nbsp; As they are seated, there is
not one point to distinguish them from men; the dressing and
powdering of the hair; their well-starched neckcloths; the upper
part of their habits, which they always wear even at a
dinner-party, made precisely like men&rsquo;s coats, and regular
black beaver hats.&nbsp; They exactly looked like two respectable
superannuated clergymen.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In returning through the churchyard we passed the monument to
the memory of Lady Eleanor Butler, Miss Ponsonby, and their
faithful servant, Mary Carroll.</p>
<p>The church is of considerable antiquity, but has very little
left of architectural beauty; some fine carvings on the roof and
in the interior still attest its former consequence.&nbsp; It is
noteworthy, however, inasmuch as the remains of the saint to whom
it is dedicated are <a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>buried under its sacred roof.&nbsp; Pennant gives his
name in full, which is <i>Saint Collen ab Gwynnawg</i>, <i>ab
Clydawg</i>, <i>ab Cowrda</i>, <i>ab Caradog Vreicvhras</i>,
<i>ab Llyr Merim</i>, <i>ab Einion Yrth</i>, <i>ab Cunedda
Wledig</i>, by <i>Ethni Wyddeles</i>, daughter to
<i>Matholwch</i>, lord of <i>Cwl</i>, in the kingdom of
<i>Ireland</i>.</p>
<p>We now returned with good appetites to do justice to the fare
provided by our host of the Hand, and here I was first destined
to hear the sounds of the Welsh harp.&nbsp; As we discussed our
fare, the harper in the hall played up his liveliest tunes.</p>
<p>Breakfast being despatched, we slung our pistols, <i>i.e.</i>,
leathern bottles, filled with <i>eau de vie</i>, to our sides,
and started to view the ruins of Dinas Br&acirc;n, an ancient
fortress up the summit of a conical mountain, which forms the
principal feature of this portion of the vale, and is indeed a
striking object from almost every part of the
neighbourhood.&nbsp; The ascent begins near the foot of the
ancient bridge opposite to the town, which was built in the early
part of the fourteenth century, by the first John Trevor, Bishop
of St. Asaph.&nbsp; The view through the arches, either up or
down the river, is extremely picturesque.</p>
<p>My companion was strongly built, and being accustomed to
rambling amongst the Welsh vales and over its steepest mountains,
far outstripped me in the ascent, which was by no means
easy.&nbsp; We took a zig-zag direction up the hill, which was
too precipitous to mount in a direct way, and as we approached
the <a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>summit
the ascent became more difficult; at length, after some little
toil, we stood by the side of the <i>Well</i>, whose pure water
gave joy to the inhabitants of this ancient fortress many hundred
years ago, and still offers a welcome draught to the pilgrim who
possesses sufficient perseverance to seek it.</p>
<p>The view from the summit of this mountain is beautiful in the
extreme; commanding the vale east to west, with the widely
spreading plains beyond its eastern extremity, and the grand and
picturesque mountain scenery which forms the western
boundary.&nbsp; Chirk Castle, Wynnstay, Valle Crucis Abbey, and
Glyndwrdu, are distinctly visible from this elevation, while the
romantic Dee is seen winding beneath, in light and shadow
beautifully varied by the hills and woods that droop over its
banks.</p>
<h3>CASTELL DINAS BRAN.</h3>
<p>The present remains of this ancient fortress are a few
scattered walls.&nbsp; There is little doubt that it is of
British origin, but the period of its erection, as well as the
name of its founder is buried in oblivion.&nbsp; The original
dimensions of its walls were about 300 feet long and 150 feet
broad.</p>

</a></p>
<p>In the reign of Henry the Third it afforded an asylum from his
enraged countrymen to Gruffydd ab Madoc, who basely betrayed his
country to that monarch.</p>
<p>In 1390 this castle was inhabited by Myvanwy <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>Vechan, a
most beautiful and accomplished female.&nbsp; She was of the
house of Tudor Trevor, and her father, Ednyved Vychan, then held
the castle under the noble Earl of Arundel, in the reign of the
unfortunate Richard the Second.&nbsp; She was beloved by Howel ab
Einion Lygliw, a celebrated bard, who addressed her in a most
charming ode.</p>
<p>On the north-west side of the hill is an adjacent rock called
Craig Eglwyseg, or the Eagle&rsquo;s Rock.&nbsp; For more than
half a mile this rock lies stratum upon stratum, in such a manner
as to form a kind of steps, parallel with the horizon, called by
naturalists <i>saxa sedilia</i>, affording a remarkable
geological phenomenon.</p>
<h3>VALLE CRUCIS ABBEY,</h3>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p40b.jpg">
<img alt=

"Valle Crucis Abbey"
 src="images/p40s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Like most abbeys, is beautifully situated.&nbsp; The monks of
old well appreciated the value of rich lands and clear
streams.&nbsp; This exquisite relic of a past age was founded in
the year 1200, by Gruffydd ab Madoc, Lord of Bromfield and Yale,
and of the neighbouring castle, Dinas Br&acirc;n; and in
conformity with the rule of the Cistercian fraternity, was
dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary.&nbsp; The remains of the
abbey at present existing consist of the church, and of a
building on the southern side, part of which seems to have formed
the abbot&rsquo;s lodgings, the refectory, and the dormitory
above, now tenanted by a farmer.&nbsp; The church is a cruciform
building, of which the northern <a name="page41"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>side has been almost destroyed, and
no vestige remains of the roof except in the eastern aisle of the
southern transept.</p>
<p>In the midst of these hallowed precincts, and until the last
twelvemonths, the rubbish was heaped up to a great height,
probably by the fall of the northern wall, and by the remains of
the roof, but through the praiseworthy exertions of a nobleman in
the neighbourhood, Viscount Dungannon, the whole has been cleared
away, leaving the pavement and sides as they existed in former
days.</p>
<p>The eastern end is most ancient, and it is adorned by three
lancet arches, forming one grand window.</p>
<p>The entrance was in the west, under a broad and beautiful
window, above which is a smaller one of marigold form, decorated
with tracery and fret work, and beneath it may be deciphered the
following inscription:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Quiescat ame</span></p>
<p>+ <span class="smcap">Adam Abbas fecit hoc Opus i
Pace</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The intelligent <i>cicerone</i> of this ancient building is
Miss Jane Lloyd, who has lived in this retired but delightful
spot for some years.&nbsp; She has a perfect knowledge of the
Welsh language, and of the history of these interesting ruins,
which no one who has visited them can cease to remember with
admiration and regret.</p>
<h3><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>THE
PILLAR OF ELISEG.</h3>
<p>Not far from the abbey, in a field called Llwyn-y-Groes, or
the Grove of the Cross, stands this famous pillar, which was
erected above a thousand years ago to the memory of Eliseg, the
father of a Prince of Powis, called Brochwel Ysgythrog, who met
his death at the Battle of Chester, in 607.</p>
<p>It is among the first lettered stones that succeed the
Meini-Hirion, Meini-Gwyr, and Llechau, and stood on a great
tumulus, perhaps always environed with wood, according to the
custom of the most ancient times.&nbsp; During the civil wars it
was thrown down and broken, and the shaft, which was originally
twelve feet, is now reduced to eight.&nbsp; At the suggestion of
Mr. Price, Bodleian Librarian, and a great antiquary, Mr. Lloyd,
of Trevor Hall, had it placed in its present position.</p>
<p>From Valle Crucis Abbey we proceeded to the banks of the Dee,
and crossing the rude bridge over the river, struck into the high
road to Corwen.&nbsp; The country became highly
interesting.&nbsp; The mountains are lofty; and beneath, upon the
right, Glyndwrdu the <i>Valley of the Dee</i>, discloses its
picturesque beauty.</p>
<p>The vale is so serpentine that it presents a succession of
most exquisite views, and after a walk of three miles, on looking
back, Castell Dinas Br&acirc;n seems placed upon a lower
eminence.&nbsp; The Valley of Llangollen may be seen likewise
from hence for many miles, terminated by the distant horizon.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p42b.jpg">

</a></p>
<p><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>The
Valley of the Dee was the patrimony of the renowned
Glyndwr&mdash;Shakspere&rsquo;s Glendower&mdash;and with many a
mountain side and summit do the natives delight to associate his
name.&nbsp; Just beyond the seventh mile-stone, will be seen a
kind of tumulus crested with a clump of firs; this is
Glyndwr&rsquo;s Mount, and is, we believe, fixed upon as the site
of his palace.</p>
<p>After passing the picturesque village of Llansaintfraid,
nothing occurs to arrest the attention till Corwen is
reached.&nbsp; The hotel is named after the mighty Owen, and has
a gigantic head over the door, much resembling the
Saracen&rsquo;s, of Snow Hill notoriety.</p>
<p>The first question put to the jolly landlord was, &ldquo;What
can you give us to eat?&rdquo;&mdash;It was about three
o&rsquo;clock in the day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, sir, there is a nice roast duck, and some
peas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how long, pray, will it be before it is
ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A quarter of an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, that will do; and in the interim I will
visit the church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few minutes I was conducted to the ancient edifice.</p>
<p>On one side of the altar is the lid of a coffin, which bears
the following inscription:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Hic jacet Jorwerth
Sulien</span>, <span class="smcap">Vicarius de
Corvaen</span>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Ora pro
eo</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the church wall is shewn the private doorway <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>through which
Owen Glyndwr entered the building whenever he attended divine
worship, and in the rock which overhangs the churchyard, there is
a recess which bears the name of Owen Glyndwr&rsquo;s Chair; and
the stone which now forms the lintel of the doorway leading to
his pew, is said to retain the mark of his dagger, half an inch
in depth, which he threw from the said chair; but upon what
occasion it is not stated.</p>
<p>In the cemetery there is a Cross, fixed in a circular stone,
westward of the steeple; and it is supposed that the name of
Corwen is a corruption of Corvaen, and derived from this
Cross.&nbsp; <i>Cor</i> signifies a circle, and <i>maen</i>
(which is likewise considered to have been changed into
<i>vaen</i>) if joined to <i>cor</i>, means a cross in the
circle.</p>
<p>Having satisfied my curiosity here, I returned to the inn, and
the first object which met my delighted eyes, was the promised
duck, accompanied by a dish of most elegant trout: a dainty for
which I had been longing ever since I entered this territory of
rocks and torrents.&nbsp; My friend was already placed at the
table, and he clapped his hands, and rubbed them with evident
delight and satisfaction at seeing me arrive so opportunely.</p>
<p>The fish despatched, duck and green peas, in close column
brought up the rear.&nbsp; But I and my gallant comrade&mdash;a
better trencherman ne&rsquo;er poised a fork&mdash;attacked in
line, cut up the one, and routed the other with the most
determined bravery.&nbsp; The right and <a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>left wings
were attacked and cut off from the main body, which, with all its
materials, we dispersed in the glorious conflict, remaining
masters of the field.</p>
<p>Although I thus warmly express my satisfaction at partaking of
this not-easily-to-be-forgotten luxury, let me not be mistaken
for a gourmand; but a wet and tired traveller, however much his
mind may be enchanted by the scenery through which he passes,
never beholds a more delightful prospect than a comfortable meal
at his journey&rsquo;s end.</p>
<p>It so happened, however, that this was not to be my
journey&rsquo;s end, as it was my intention to reach Bala before
nightfall.</p>
<p>At this spot my companion and I were to separate: his path lay
towards Cerrig-y-druidion, and mine towards Llandrillo and the
Vale of Edeyrnion.</p>
<p>With a feeling of regret I never before experienced at
quitting a new acquaintance of so short a standing, I squeezed
his hand, and once more took the road for another walk of ten
miles.</p>
<p>At a short distance from Corwen, a road branches off to the
left, along which the traveller should trudge to the village of
Llandrillo, and he will be repaid by the sight of one of the most
fertile valleys in Wales.&nbsp; It is a mile farther to Bala by
this route, but the superior beauty of the scenery will amply
recompence him for the extra distance, for, with the exception of
a view of Bala Lake, obtained from an eminence, the road, which
runs along the opposite side of the valley, <a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>is dull and
uninviting.&nbsp; But on the contrary, by the Llandrillo route,
the eye is delighted with a succession of scenes varied and
interesting in the extreme.&nbsp; Huge masses of rock hang over
the road upon the left, in threatening grandeur, while waving
woods and falling streams give endless variety to the
picture.</p>
<p>After proceeding five miles, I crossed a bridge over a fine
trout-stream, the banks of which are shaded with trees, and
turning into an avenue upon the right, seated myself by the
margin of the brook, secured from the hot rays of the mid-day
sun, I fancied myself the melancholy Jacques.&nbsp; There only
wanted a wounded stag, to make the illusion perfect.</p>
<p>As I entered the village of Llandrillo, I was much delighted
with the lively scene.&nbsp; The long street was crowded with
peasantry, in their holiday clothes.&nbsp; On each side were
stalls, formed of tubs turned upside down, and boards placed upon
them, to support their merchandise; square patches strewed with
straw and covered with crockery and glass; tables well stored
with woollen hose and mittens; and stands of gingerbread and
ginger-pop were liberally stationed in different quarters, to
gratify and refresh the happy throng.&nbsp; At times, a sudden
opening in the crowd took place, the whole mass of people jamming
each other upon either side of the street, to make way for a
trotting pony, or an ambling nag, to curvet and prance down the
middle and up again, to show his paces.&nbsp; At the upper end of
the fair, a hardware man harangued a <a name="page47"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 47</span>crowd of people from his travelling
warehouse (a covered cart,) endeavouring to persuade them that he
came to Llandrillo solely for their benefit, and for no selfish
motive upon earth, and labouring to convince them, in
brazier-like eloquence, that the articles he offered to their
notice were considerably under prime cost, and could not be
purchased elsewhere for treble the money; but, though he sold at
a great sacrifice to himself, he begged them not to consider his
loss, but their gain; such an opportunity would never again
present itself, therefore now was their only time to buy
cheap!</p>
<p>A party of Welsh girls attracted my attention, gathered
together in front of a wall, upon which a line of men&rsquo;s
hats were ranged, of various qualities and prices; and great glee
and laughter were elicited as each fitted the new beaver upon her
head, it being considered the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of taste, and
a powerful auxiliary to the coquetry of a Welsh girl.</p>
<p>Leaving Llandrillo, and proceeding towards Bala, the traveller
enters the</p>
<h3>VALE OF EDEYRNION.</h3>
<p>The mountains here, upon either side, are covered with
plantations, and the beautiful Dee winds gracefully in the centre
of the valley, through delightful meadows, while corn fields wave
upon the sloping banks, and everything presents to the eye the
appearance of freshness and fertility, cheerfulness and <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>content.&nbsp; At the bridge near Llanddervel, a small
village, which is first observed upon the opposite bank of the
Dee, a splendid view presents itself.&nbsp; The river here is
broad, shallow, and deep, by turns, and looking up or down the
vale, its meandering sportiveness charms the eye.&nbsp; At the
extremity of the valley is a lofty mountain, planted to the
summit, which seems so closely to envelope it as to prevent all
egress.&nbsp; To stand upon this bridge at sunset, and listen to
the whistle of the sheep-boy as he trudges merrily along the
road, the song of the husbandman, or the joyous laugh of the
milkmaids&mdash;sounds that float upon the silent air for miles,
at such an hour&mdash;the twittering of the birds&mdash;the low
crake of the rail, amidst the corn&mdash;and sweeter than all,
the music of the river, discharging liquid sounds from its
transparent bosom&mdash;creates a sensation which we are at a
loss how to express.&nbsp; Excess of pleasure becomes painful;
and, overpowered with delight, nature asserts her influence, and
we experience the luxury of tears!&mdash;at least, I did, and I
pity from my soul the man who is unfortunately incapable of a
similar feeling.</p>
<p>Passing through the little village of Llanvor, and crossing a
stream over the bridge close by the lodge of Mr. Price, of
Rhiwlas, I at length arrived at the White Lion, in the town of
Bala; and, tired with my day&rsquo;s exertions, called for a
tea-dinner and slippers, and early retired to rest.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the following morning I found
myself unable to walk, from the effect produced by a sprained
ancle, and I had the delightful prospect of being confined to the
room of an inn in a country town, without a being to converse
with, or a book to enliven me; but my kind landlord, a fine,
portly, rosy-cheeked, round-headed, honest-hearted Boniface, as
ever drew spigot, kindly offered me a pony, to take me to the
lake, which, he said, contained plenty of perch.&nbsp; This offer
I thankfully accepted, and, by the aid of mine host and his
ostler, was soon seated upon the back of a quiet
not-to-be-put-out-of-his-way animal, as any clerical gentleman
could desire to ride upon, and</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;With slow and solemn pace,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>proceeded to catch fish, and view the scenery around</p>
<h3>LLYN TEGID, OR BALA LAKE.</h3>
<p>Seated upon a rock that projects into the lake (under the
shadow of which is the boat-house of Mr. Price, of Rhiwlas,) I
commenced my solitary pastime; but my eyes continually wandered
from the float to the surrounding scenery, which is of a pleasing
rather than an imposing nature.&nbsp; The lake was slightly
ruffled by a refreshing breeze, which fortunately sprang up, and
prevented me from dissolving in the heat of the sun.&nbsp; It is
about four miles in length, and in some parts it is forty yards
in depth.&nbsp; The shores are sloping, the soil gravelly, and
delightfully variegated with plantations of trees and
shrubs.&nbsp; Towards the head of the lake the mountains are upon
a very grand scale, and rival Snowdon in their altitude; Arran
Vowddwy is the loftiest of these, near the summit of which, upon
its eastern side, beneath a huge crag, is situated a lake, which
affords excellent sport to the angler, although the fish are not
of the finest quality.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p50b.jpg">
<img alt=
"Bala Lake"
title=
"Bala Lake"
 src="images/p50s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Arrenig Vawr, (or great,) which is nearly as lofty as Arran
Vowddwy, and rises upon the N.W. side of the Llyn, has also a
lake, containing trout of a large size, which are noted for
rejecting the artificial fly; but, about half way up the Arrenig
V&acirc;ch, (or little,) is a lake, which, when a light breeze
sweeps along its surface, will amply reward the angler for his
trouble in reaching it.&nbsp; A morning and an evening, at each
of <a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>these
places, enable me to state thus much, for the benefit of the
disciples of Izaac Walton.</p>
<p>I was suddenly aroused from a dream of pleasure, which I was
enjoying with my eyes open, by a tug at my line, reminding me
that a fish had swallowed the hook.&nbsp; After a little
coquetting, which lovers usually make use of, I brought it to my
arms, and then thrust it into my bag: a fine perch!&nbsp; I now
resolved to begin in earnest, and in an hour, by my temptation
and insinuation, contrived to obtain a very handsome dish, with
which I returned upon my pony to the inn, resigning them and
myself to the care of mine hostess.</p>
<p>The town of Bala consists of one long street, has about 2500
inhabitants, and is celebrated for its manufacture of woollen
articles, such as stockings, gloves, and formerly Welsh
wigs.&nbsp; Upon an eminence at the S.E. end of the town, the old
women and young girls assemble in considerable numbers, during
the summer months, to pursue their industrious avocations in the
open air.&nbsp; The mound is called Tommen y Bala; it is said to
be of Roman construction, and from the summit a very fine view
may be obtained of Llyn Tegid and the mountains.&nbsp; There is a
town hall, and a chapel of ease to the parish church at Llanycil,
about a mile distant, where the morning service is read in
English only upon the first Sunday in each month.</p>
<p>Rising early the following morning I found no inconvenience
from my ancle, and after a good breakfast took leave of my host
and his wife, both of whom appeared <a name="page52"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>anxious to see me comfortably seated
in the vehicle.</p>
<p>The car in which I was bumped along the road, in every respect
resembled those delightful conveyances that rattle the astonished
traveller from Cork to Blarney.&nbsp; It is a sort of oval box,
placed upon two wheels, with a door behind, and with good wedging
will contain four persons; but being springless and cushionless,
the passenger is jolted to his heart&rsquo;s content, that is, if
his heart has been set on jolting; and, without doubt, it is fine
exercise for persons of sedentary habits, if by any chance, their
bones happen to escape dislocation.&nbsp; My knapsack (my
opposite, and only fellow passenger) and I, looked very black at
each other, as we bobbed up and down, like a cockney
grocer&rsquo;s apprentice upon a high trotting horse; but I soon
became resigned, and my knapsack having shifted its berth for the
bottom of the vehicle, seemed to rest more comfortably than on
the seat.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the inconvenience I suffered from
this carriage, I could not help admiring the extreme beauty of
the lake, as we pursued our course along its borders; sometimes
only catching a glimpse of it through the trees that shaded its
delightful margin.&nbsp; Its waters were smooth and motionless;
not a ripple was visible upon its surface; the lofty mountains
reflected in its breast gave a sombre tinge to the otherwise
golden scene, and as I looked into the clear depths of the
shadows, I thought how peacefully one shattered by <a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>the storms of
life might sink beneath, and be at rest!</p>
<p>After passing Glan y Llyn (an estate belonging to Sir W. W.
Wynn, who claims the whole fishing of this beautiful piece of
water, and has, by putting a quantity of pike therein, destroyed
all the trout and gwynniad with which it once abounded) the
scenery became wild, and cheerless, until we reached</p>
<h3>THE VALE OF DRWS Y NANT,</h3>
<p>where, to my great satisfaction, the car stopped at the sign
of the Welsh Prince, a distance of ten miles from Bala, and eight
from Dolgelley.&nbsp; Being thoroughly tired with my ride, I
thought I would endeavour to obtain the proper use of my limbs,
and rest myself by walking the remainder of the journey.&nbsp;
Dismissing the car, therefore, and strapping my knapsack to my
shoulders, I once more took the road.</p>
<p>About a mile beyond the Welsh Prince the valley becomes truly
beautiful.&nbsp; Waving woods adorn the mountains upon either
side.&nbsp; The Wnion here begins to be an important stream; and,
though in its course towards Dolgelley it is swelled by numerous
mountain tributaries into a broad river, the trees upon its banks
form an impenetrable screen, which conceal it from the traveller,
and its hoarse murmur, as it dashes over the rocks that vainly
endeavour to intercept its way, alone remind him of its
vicinity.&nbsp; At length I arrived at a spot where a road leads
over a bridge to the opposite <a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>side of the river.&nbsp; Thinking
this would be a proper place to see the Wnion to advantage, I
advanced to the centre of the bridge.&nbsp; The effect is
beautiful; hanging woods adorn the banks of the stream, lofty-ash
trees (around the trunks of which the ivy winds itself in
snakelike folds, feeding upon the tree that supports it), spread
their proud heads above, and form a pleasing shade, while below
the river roars, as it is precipitated beneath the arch in two
large falls, that form a deep pool on the opposite side.</p>
<p>Nearly the whole of this lovely valley is the property of Sir
Robert Vaughan.&nbsp; Pursuing my journey towards Dolgelley, a
sudden turn in the road and an opening in the dell revealed to my
delighted eyes the celebrated mountain called Cader Idris.</p>
<h3>CADER IDRIS,</h3>
<p>the loftiest mountain in Merionethshire, and the second in
North Wales, is said to be 950 yards in perpendicular height from
Dolgelley Green.&nbsp; Cader Idris literally means
&ldquo;Idris&rsquo;s chair,&rdquo; where he is supposed to have
studied astrology; and Idris is a name attributed to Enoch, the
founder of astronomy.&nbsp; Mr. Edward Jones, to whom the public
are indebted for his learned and ingenious work, entitled
&ldquo;The Bardic Museum,&rdquo; observes that &ldquo;Caer Idris
implies the city of the learned;&rdquo; and Mr. Rowland, in his
&ldquo;Mona Antiqua,&rdquo; mentions a place in Anglesey called
Caer Idris, also B&ocirc;d Idris, or &ldquo;Idris&rsquo;s abode
or mansion,&rdquo; in Yale, <a name="page55"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 55</span>Denbighshire, which still retains the
name, as well as that of Ll&ecirc;ch Idris, or &ldquo;the shelter
of Idris,&rdquo; a farm so called, at Trawsvynydd in
Merionethshire, which also may imply the grave of Idris.&nbsp;
Idris is supposed to have flourished in the third or fourth
century, and his genealogy from an old manuscript, runs
thus:&mdash;&ldquo;Idris Gawr ab Gwyddno, ab Tibion, ab Cunedda
Wledig.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p54b.jpg">
<img alt=

title=
"Cader Idris, from the Bala Road"
 src="images/p54s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Snowdon and Cader Idris were formerly supposed to be the
Parnassian hills of Wales, and none but good bards could claim so
elevated a seat.</p>
<p>Idris, the champion or bard, invented the harp; or if the
Gomerian Britons brought that instrument into the country, when
they first inhabited the island, it seems to have been lost and
forgotten; for Idris is said to have invented something similar;
but it is probable he only made some improvement on the ancient
harp, or perhaps his superior skill in performing on it might
have gained him that reputation.&nbsp; From all that can be
gathered from tradition, he was a learned man, an astrologer, and
a bard; and it is likely that the summit of this mountain was
chosen by him, to examine from thence the movements of the
heavenly bodies, to write his inspired verses, or to frame laws
for the government and benefit of his country.</p>
<p>The walk from this spot to Dolgelley is exceedingly beautiful;
and as the tourist approaches the town before crossing the bridge
which is flung over the river Mawddach, a sign of some importance
attracts his attention upon the right: it runs thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><a

</blockquote>
<h3>DOLGELLEY,</h3>
<p>or Dolgelleu, the Dale of the Hazel, is the principal market
town in Merionethshire, and the assizes are held here,
alternately with Bala.&nbsp; The town hall, the most important
building, is a neat stone edifice, erected in the year 1825, and
cost &pound;3000.&nbsp; It is built near the banks of the river
Wnion, (pronounced Oonion) and the court room is fitted up with
every necessary accommodation for the officers of justice.&nbsp;
In the hall is a very fine portrait of Sir R. W. Vaughan, Bart.,
painted by Sir M. A. Shee, F.R.A.</p>
<p>Part of an old building, called &ldquo;Cwrt Pl&acirc;s yn-y
Dr&ecirc;v,&rdquo; or the Town-hall Court, is still remaining
amongst a range of wretched hovels at the back of the post
office, in which a parliament was held by Owen Glyndwr.&nbsp; The
county jail at the outskirts of the town is of a semi-circular
form, built of stone, and was erected in 1811, at an expense of
&pound;5000.</p>
<p>St. Mary&rsquo;s Church is a neat limestone edifice, of
Grecian architecture, with a handsome tower, and an expansive
nave.&nbsp; In it is an ancient monument of an armed knight, who
is represented in a suit of mail, helmet, a neck guard, a sword
in his hand, and a dog <a name="page57"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>at his feet; a lion passant gardant
is on his shield, upon which is inscribed: &ldquo;Hic jacet
Mauric Filius Ynyr Vychan.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is a modern one
lately erected to the memory of Baron Richards.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>The town is celebrated for a manufacture of coarse woollen
cloths and flannels, called webs.&nbsp; The old town-hall is used
for various purposes; English church service is performed there
every other Sunday; it is also used as a national school, and
children are there taught to sing the church psalms.&nbsp; It is
likewise known as the theatre.</p>
<p>Those fond of fine scenery should ascend the mountain from the
north side of the vale, to obtain the best view of the town, as
it lies sheltered at the foot of the majestic Cader Idris, which
rears its lofty shoulders in the clouds.</p>
<p>Clustering woods adorn the opposite range of mountains, as
they slope in irregular masses westward to the ocean.&nbsp; The
river beautifully meandering through the green meadows, the
solemn quietude that prevails around, disturbed only by the sound
of the church clock, marking the progress of the fleeting hours
with lengthened tone, which, like the music of another world,
sweeps through the enchanting vale, combine to render this a
place where those not wedded to routs, masquerades, gambling, and
licentiousness, might wish to live and die.</p>
<p>Dolgelley contains several good inns, of which the most
frequented are the Golden Lion, the Angel, and the Ship.&nbsp;
Comfortable lodgings may likewise be obtained, <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>at a cheap
rate, by those who desire to remain in the neighbourhood for the
purpose of making excursions to the Falls, Kymmer Abbey, and
Nannau Park, the fishing stations, Dol y Gamedd on the Aran,
Llyn-tri-Graienyn, Llyn y Gader, Llyn Geirw, Tal y Llyn,
&amp;c.</p>
<p>The tourist should not quit Dolgelley without visiting the
Waterfalls, which, after heavy rains, are very magnificent.&nbsp;
As I was still suffering from the severe sprain, I was
accommodated by my friend, who also obliged me with his company,
with a very fine horse to carry me to the falls; and, bold and
sure-footed, he performed his duty nobly, in spite of crags,
cliffs, hills, and hollows.</p>
<h3>THE RHAIADR DU</h3>
<p>is situated in the grounds belonging to Miss Madock, called
D&ocirc;l Melynllyn.&nbsp; Here the torrent leaps from a height
of sixty feet over precipitous rocks, and plunges with a violence
that seems to shake the crags and trees around, into a deep pool,
from which it proceeds down the dingle, over black and broken
fragments, to the river Mawddach.&nbsp; A footpath conducts the
tourist to the bottom of the falls, from which, stepping upon
some loose stones in the middle of the stream, he will obtain the
best view of the cataract.&nbsp; A walk of about three miles
brings him to the falls of the Mawddach and Pistyll y Cain,
returning from which, he may visit Y Vanner, or Kymmer Abbey,
founded in 1198, by Meredith and Gruffydd, lords of Merioneth,
dedicated <a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>to St. Mary, and inhabited by monks of the Cistercian
order.&nbsp; It is not now, however, worthy of the
tourist&rsquo;s attention.&nbsp; But Nannau Park, the seat of Sir
Robert William Vaughan, will afford much pleasure to those who
visit it.&nbsp; The grounds are thickly wooded, and the mansion
is supposed to occupy the highest ground of any residence in
Britain.&nbsp; The approach to it is five miles in length; it
stands 702 feet above the level of the sea, and the park is
celebrated for its venison.&nbsp; Previously to the year 1814,
there stood an oak in this park which bore a name terrible to the
ears of the peasantry; it was called</p>
<h3>DERWEN CEUBREN YR ELLYLL,</h3>
<p>which translated, means, &ldquo;the hollow oak, the haunt of
demons.&rdquo;&nbsp; In this oak, it is said, Owen Glyndwr
immured the body of Howell Sele, the proprietor of this estate,
who, while they were walking together, treacherously shot an
arrow at the breast of Glyndwr, who, however, having armour
beneath his doublet, fortunately received no hurt.&nbsp; The
cause of this treachery is said to have been the indignation
expressed by Owen at his kinsman&rsquo;s refusal to join his
cause to redress his country&rsquo;s wrongs.&nbsp; Glyndwr forced
his body into the hollow of this oak, most likely after having
slain him, where, forty years after this event, a skeleton was
discovered.&nbsp; The chieftain, after laying waste the mansion
and domain of Sele, hastened to join his friends.&nbsp; Sir W.
Scott has written a very beautiful poem upon <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>this legend,
which will be found in the fifth note to his sixth canto of
Marmion, and is called the &ldquo;spirit&rsquo;s blasted
tree.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1813, this monarch of the wood fell to the
ground.</p>
<p>The country from Dolgelley to the mouth of the river is well
worth a journey of three hundred miles to visit, even though
there were no other objects worthy of notice in North Wales, and
will amply compensate the most eager researcher after the sublime
and beautiful.</p>
<p>At a turn of the coach road from a place called Ty-gwyn, a
splendid view of Cader Idris is obtained, particularly in the
evening, when the mists arise from the numerous lakes in the
vicinity, like volumes of smoke from a domain of fire, curling in
fantastic forms around the mountain&rsquo;s waist, leaving its
summit stern and clear in an unclouded sky&mdash;like a proud
giant surveying with disdain the dwarfish host of which he is the
leader.</p>
<p>Another noble view attracts attention, at a place called Glan
Mawddach&mdash;the broad arm of the sea, stretching for miles
between the rugged mountains, which, shrouded in veils of silvery
mist, fling their dark shadows into the depths of the
water.&nbsp; Arriving at</p>
<h3>BARMOUTH,</h3>
<p>the coach stopped at the Corsygedol Arms; but I proceeded to
the Commercial Inn, where there is very good accommodation, and a
good look-out seaward.&nbsp; A <a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>warm bath of sea water refreshed me;
and by the star light I strolled upon the sands, which are very
hard and pleasant to walk upon, while my repast was preparing at
the inn.&nbsp; The night was calm and serene, and my mind
naturally adapted itself to the surrounding scene.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The brave o&rsquo;erhanging firmament&mdash;the majestical
roof fretted with golden fire,&rdquo; appeared to me far from
being &ldquo;a foul and pestilent congregation of
vapours.&rdquo;&nbsp; My soul took wing, and bounded from star to
star, leaping the realms of space, and plunging into infinity,
till wearied with its immeasurable flight, it resought its
earthly tenement, and my body, which it left immoveable, as if
transformed to marble, resumed its functions.&nbsp; The low moan
of the ocean swam on my ear, like heavenly music.&nbsp; A light
breeze brought with it delicious freshness; and, as I looked
towards the land, all seemed as quiet as the abode of
peace.&nbsp; The lights from the houses had a pleasing effect, as
they streamed through the windows, row above row, under and upon
the side of the overhanging cliffs.</p>
<p>I returned to &ldquo;mine inn,&rdquo; and my meal being
despatched, retired to bed.</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><span

</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Barmouth</span>, or Aber-Maw, derives its
name from being situated at the embouchure of the river Maw or
Mawddach, which at the entrance is obstructed by a bar.&nbsp; The
old town, viewed from the sea, resembles a fortress of some
strength, hanging immediately over the sands.&nbsp; In most cases
a lofty situation is an advantage, but here it is the reverse;
for so steep is the side of the cliff on which it stands, that
the inhabitants of the upper regions are completely smoke-dried
from the chimneys of all the dwellings beneath.</p>
<p>The new town stands at the base of the rock, and but for some
mounds of sand, that appear likely to <a name="page63"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>grow into mountains by the influence
of the winds and waves, would inevitably be washed away by the
spring tides.&nbsp; Some of the fishermen&rsquo;s habitations on
the beach are at times buried in the drifting sands; and, after a
strong wind from the seaward, the inhabitants generally labour
hard to clear the obstruction from their doors.</p>
<p>Barmouth had few visitors during my stay, and from the report
of those I met with, is greatly decreasing in popularity, which
says but little in favour of the lovers of fine scenery.&nbsp;
When the tide is at full, the panorama around the estuary cannot
be surpassed in beauty.&nbsp; The majestic river winds amongst
rocks, clad with purple heather, or projecting in barren
grandeur, that lift their jagged summits tier over tier, and peak
overtopping peak, while still tremendous, towering over all, the
lofty Idris looms in the back ground.&nbsp; Green hills and woody
promontories, forests that stretch into the dark recesses of the
mountains, villas and copsewood glens, give an endless variety to
the romantic scene.</p>
<p>The town contains about 2000 inhabitants, and there is a
manufactory of flannels and woollen stockings.</p>
<p>At noon, as I was basking upon the sands, or Friar&rsquo;s
Island, which is situated at the mouth of the river, I had the
pleasure to see my new acquaintance and friend gallop into the
town, and old Charon having ferried me from the island to the
main land once more, I hastened to welcome him, as fast as my
damaged limb would suffer me.&nbsp; He proposed driving me to
Corsygedol Hall, <a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>the seat of the Hon. E. M. L. Mostyn; which being agreed
to, I ordered dinner to be ready at our return, and we
started.&nbsp; The drive upon the Harlech road is bleak; upon the
right, the hills are barren; and seaward, beneath the road, is an
extensive flat, consisting chiefly of bog land and far from
interesting.&nbsp; About a mile and a half from the town stands
the Church of Llan Aber, upon the extreme verge of a cliff which
overlooks the ocean.&nbsp; The Carnarvonshire mountains have a
fine effect stretching into the sea; of which the Rivals, with
their lofty peaks, are noble objects in the distance.&nbsp;
Following the chain, the eye rests for a moment upon Carn Bodean,
and in the flat between it and Carn Madryn is the town of
Pwllheli.&nbsp; The chain is resumed at Rhiw mountain, and
terminates at Aberdaron point, three leagues from which is
Bardsey Island, a conspicuous and interesting object; for there
dwelt the bards of old, amongst whom were numbered the fathers of
science, the national interpreters, musicians, and legislators,
priests, and princes of Cambria.&nbsp; With their oratory they
soothed the savage ignorance of mankind into civilization and
knowledge, and polished their minds with the powerful aid of
music and poetry.&nbsp; After the dreadful slaughter of the monks
of Bangor, those who survived took shelter upon this
island.&nbsp; A few ruined walls alone remain of the ancient
abbey; and the inhabitants, who do not exceed one hundred
persons, support themselves chiefly by fishing.</p>
<p><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>About
three miles from Barmouth, upon the summit of the mountain called
Dinas Gortin, are the remains of a military encampment, and near
to the town there stood a tower, where it is said the Earl of
Richmond used to conceal himself, when he visited his secret
allies in this part of the country.</p>
<p>Near the military station, are the tombs of the celebrated men
of Ardudwy; who, in imitation of the Roman robbers, made an
incursion into Denbighshire, and overcoming the men, forcibly
tore the women from their families, and returned in triumph with
them to their own country.</p>
<p>But the men of Denbighshire, rallying, pursued the spoilers,
and overtaking them in the pass of Drws Ardudwy, routed them with
great slaughter.&nbsp; But the infatuated women had by this time
conceived so extraordinary a passion for their violators, that
rather than survive their loss, or perhaps more probably, to
escape the fury of their former husbands, they drowned themselves
in a lake, which is called the Llyn y Morwynion, or Pool of the
Maidens.</p>
<p>About two miles further, a road up a steep ascent conducted us
to a fine avenue of trees, through which we passed, and at the
termination of it came to a handsome gateway called Porth Mawr,
which admitted us into the mansion of Corsygedol, which has
nothing in it to interest the tourist.&nbsp; The interior of the
building is incommodious and inelegant.&nbsp; The drawing-room <a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>contains a
few wretched portraits and high-backed chairs; and the rest of
the apartments are meanly furnished.</p>
<p>We returned to Barmouth by the sea shore, and after a most
delightful drive upon Neptune&rsquo;s boundaries, arrived at the
inn, where the evening was passed in conviviality, tempered with
prudence, and sweetened by social and interesting
conversation.&nbsp; As I had determined upon proceeding to
Harlech the following day, my companion was resolved to make the
journey as agreeable as possible, and requesting me to forward my
knapsack, &amp;c., by the coach, informed me that he would be
ready to accompany me in the morning.&nbsp; Requesting him,
therefore, to be early at breakfast, we parted for the night.</p>
<p>After despatching a hasty meal next morning, the word was
given &ldquo;to horse and away.&rdquo;&nbsp; My old favourite who
bore me so gallantly to the black cataract, was again resigned to
my care, and I to his, gentle as a lamb, proud as a war horse,
and agile as an antelope.&nbsp; I felt like an Arab, on his
steed, and I thought I could defy the winds to overtake me.&nbsp;
We proceeded once more to Corsygedol Hall, which was the
appointed spot of rendezvous for a pic-nic party.&nbsp; Here I
had the happiness of meeting some of the choicest flowers of the
Welsh Highlands.&nbsp; Youth, beauty, freedom, and innocence,
beamed from the laughing eyes and unsullied cheeks of our fair
companions.&nbsp; The &ldquo;how d&rsquo;ye do&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
&ldquo;glad to see you,&rdquo; &ldquo;fine morning,&rdquo;
&amp;c., &amp;c., being ended, <a name="page67"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 67</span>we moved forward in a formidable
cavalcade.&nbsp; Mirth, wit, and pleasure played on the lips and
sparkled in the eyes of the whole party; and the animals that
bore us seemed to partake of the general feeling, by pricking up
their glossy ears, and bounding over the rugged road with more
spirit than prudence.&nbsp; Much mirth was occasioned by the
opening of gates and crossing of brooks.&nbsp; At length the
party plunged into a beautiful wood.&nbsp; I paused upon an
eminence to mark the effect as they descended; it was picturesque
in the extreme, as at intervals, through the openings, I caught a
partial glimpse of the troop, pursuing their cheerful way down
the steep path.&nbsp; Pleased with the sight, I passed the party
at a gallop, and arriving at the foot of the hill, remained upon
a bridge, close by the woodman&rsquo;s cottage, which crosses a
mountain stream, watching their approach.</p>
<p>It was delightful to see them advancing one by one through the
thick foliage which hung on either side of the path, and arching
over their heads.&nbsp; On arriving at the foot of the descent,
the party drew up, and, had an artist been among us, I am
confident he would have produced a picture which, even on the
lifeless canvass, would have delighted the connoisseurs of
Somerset House.</p>
<p>The variety of costume, the colour of the horses, the general
sensation of delight which lighted up the features of the gay
group; the picturesque cottage and bridge, the broad rushing
stream, the waving woods, <a name="page68"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 68</span>with now and then a glimpse of the
sterile mountains, peeping above the beautiful fertility, formed
a landscape which Salvator Rosa himself would have been delighted
to delineate.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

<img alt=

"View from Carreg y Saeth"

</a></p>
<p>Penetrating through a woody maze, a glen upon our right, and
huge wild masses of rock towering above our heads, we passed
Cravnant, a house situated in the deep shade of the lonely
wood.&nbsp; The rocks now assumed a wild and threatening aspect
upon our left, as we emerged into a more open track, and entered
upon the domain of Dolwreiddiog, a little beyond which commences
perhaps the wildest scenery in North Wales.&nbsp; Descending by a
rocky path, we came to</p>
<h3>LLYN Y CWM BYCHAN,</h3>
<p>or, the lake of the little hollow, on the opposite margin of
which, the wild and dismal Carreg-y-Saeth, the rock of the arrow,
rears its black head in fearful grandeur.&nbsp; Cwm Bychan, is a
grassy dell, surrounded on all sides by the most frightful
sterility; which, while we gazed with wonder on the sublimity of
the scene, made us shudder at the utter desolation it
presented.&nbsp; A poor cottage stands at the further end of the
valley, from which, having obtained a plentiful supply of milk,
we dismounted, and, fastening our steeds to the gates, we seated
ourselves under the shade of two trees, upon the inviting grass,
which, like the smiles of the world, proved but too treacherous;
many a scream and laugh announcing that the boggy soil had paid
no respect to <a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>the garments of either sex.&nbsp; Stones were therefore
procured, and, having ranged them in a magic circle, the whole
party seated themselves to partake of the good cheer, which a
sturdy Welshman had borne upon his shoulders, and who now
advanced into the middle of the ring.&nbsp; Knives and forks
began to play with astonishing celerity.&nbsp; Fowls, ham,
tongue, &amp;c., vanished as if by enchantment, and mirth and
good humour added zest to the repast.</p>
<p>Our lunch being concluded, we again mounted our horses, and
commenced an ascent up a dank, cheerless hollow, called Bwlch
Tyddiad.&nbsp; Nothing can exceed the wildness of the scenery by
which we were surrounded.&nbsp; Huge masses of rock, riven by the
thunderbolt, or loosened by the frost, lay scattered in every
direction, while towering upon either side, the herbless
mountains frowned, barren, black, grey, and terrible.</p>
<p>Our horses, accustomed, I presume, to such excursions, picked
their way with the greatest care and safety, and my
&ldquo;gallant brown&rdquo; cleared every impediment, as if he
had been foaled amongst the Alps, and loved them better than the
verdant plain.&nbsp; Drawing nearer to the top of the cliff, the
shepherds had made a stair-like path of flat stones, along which
our Cavalcade proceeded with caution; when suddenly we halted
upon hearing the distant halloos of travellers ascending the
opposite side of the mountain, and presently three persons, one
of whom was leading a <a name="page70"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 70</span>wearied animal by the bridle, became
distinctly visible.&nbsp; A shout of recognition from our party
roused all the echoes of the surrounding hills.&nbsp; The
figures, as they became more distinct, seemed magically
transported with myself into the heart of the Sierra Morena,
where Cardenio, Don Quixote, and Sancho Panza, appeared to me in
their proper persons; for never was description better realized
than in the figures that now presented themselves.&nbsp; The
first was a handsome, well formed man, with light brown hair,
which hung in plentiful thickness upon his shoulders; his
untrimmed beard, joined by overhanging mustachios, and the two
being united to the upper growth by a pair of whiskers, the
luxuriance of which showed they were permitted to grow in
uninterrupted freedom.&nbsp; His throat was bare, and his dress
negligent.&nbsp; The second figure that attracted my attention,
was a very tall and extremely thin young man, with a serious cast
of features that would have done honour to the knight of the
woful countenance.&nbsp; In his hand he led a jaded hack, which
in the ascent seemed to have yielded up three parts of its
existence.&nbsp; Here then was the Rosinante of Cervantes in a
breathing form; while, by his side, a short good-humoured little
man, with a large portmanteau buckled on his back, walked like a
faithful squire, and made an admirable substitute for the
immortal Sancho; and, as he turned his eyes from precipice to
glen, it required no great stretch of imagination to think they
were wandering in search of his beloved Dapple.&nbsp; We met <a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>upon a patch
of green moss; and here our hamper was again unpacked, to cheer
the hearts of these toil-worn travellers.</p>
<p>By their advice we ascended to the summit of the mountain, the
view from which was grand and extensive.&nbsp; To the eastward, a
vast country lies beneath, bounded by Cader Idris, the two
Arrenigs, and a long range of mountains.&nbsp; Immediately under
the lofty eminence upon which we rested, was a small round lake
and the pass Ardudwy, which exceeds even the celebrated Llanberis
in rugged grandeur.&nbsp; The way by which our new companions
ascended was both laborious and dangerous; but they would not
have sacrificed the prospect now presented to them on any
account.&nbsp; North and south the eye glances over the summits
of wild mountains, and to the west the Carnarvonshire chain, cut
in two, as it were, by a high mountain, immediately before us,
forms the shore of a noble sheet of water, resembling a spacious
lake, where the sea stretches its arm into the Vale of Maentwrog,
out of Cardigan Bay.&nbsp; The declining sun gave us warning that
it was time to quit these wilds, and make the best of our way to
the foot of the mountain.</p>
<p>The return is extremely hazardous on horseback.&nbsp; The
ladies of the party therefore, resigning their steeds to the
conduct of some mountaineers, and the gentlemen leading their
horses by the bridle, commenced the descent.&nbsp; But as I could
not from lameness advantage <a name="page72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>myself by like caution, and feeling
confident in the tact, strength, and docility of my favourite, I
led the way, without experiencing the slightest symptom of
uneasiness.</p>
<p>When we had proceeded about half way down, a circumstance
occurred that occasioned some unpleasantness.&nbsp; A horse had
broken loose from one of the leaders, and at full speed came
galloping down the steep and rugged descent.&nbsp; The animal
conducted by the tall, thin gentlemen before described, started
as his fellow quadruped rushed by him, and, freeing himself from
control, dashed after him at an alarming pace, leaving his late
master, with eyes starting out of their sockets, and mouth wide
open with affright, his arms spread out, and his whole frame in
convulsions of terror, upon the top of a large stone, ludicrously
bewildered.&nbsp; My steed, evincing the truth of the proverb,
&ldquo;evil communications,&rdquo; &amp;c., for a moment lost his
presence of mind, and despising my efforts to restrain him,
bounded over sundry perilous rocky fragments in desperate
pursuit.&nbsp; However, by divers forcible arguments, I at length
succeeded in convincing him of his error, and he returned to his
duty.</p>
<p>The two runaways were soon out of sight, and as we concluded
they had broken their necks, we moved rather solemnly to the
bottom of the hollow, where our fears were dissipated, by finding
them quietly browsing in the green meadows, where we had before
seated ourselves at pic-nic.&nbsp; All here remounted; the
sun&rsquo;s rays <a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>still lingering upon the heights of Carreg-y-Saeth, but
the pool below looked black and cheerless.&nbsp; As we proceeded,
the beautiful calm light of evening, the cool and refreshing air,
&ldquo;the shard borne beetle, with his drowsy hum,&rdquo; the
forest flies and midges dancing in the clear ether, the murmuring
of mountain streams, and the joyous notes of our little party,
uniting with the sharp tones of our horses&rsquo; shoes, clinking
against the rocky fragments, formed a combination of pleasing
sounds and images in this romantic solitude, which I shall ever
remember with feelings of interest and delight.&nbsp; After
riding about three miles, surrounded by every charm that could
make the time pass pleasantly, we arrived at the place of
parting.&nbsp; A road branching to the right led directly to
Harlech, a distance of about two miles; and here, with a feeling
of regret, I hardly ever before experienced, I took leave of my
kind conductor, and his agreeable friends, a man being appointed
to walk with me as far as Harlech, for the purpose of taking back
his master&rsquo;s horse.</p>
<p>Slowly and sadly I pursued my solitary ride, nor did I once
address my attendant, until I arrived at the inn, where,
dismounting, I committed to his charge my gallant supporter
throughout the day.</p>

<h3>HARLECH.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Blue Lion Inn, built by Sir R.
W. Vaughan, for the accommodation of travellers and tourists, is
most delightfully situated.&nbsp; A carriage road from the north
leads round to the front, which faces the sea; and forming a
semicircle, permits the vehicles to drive, through a gate on the
south end of the house, again into the high road.&nbsp; Great
taste is displayed in the erection of <a name="page75"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>this pleasant building; the parapet
wall, with its circular turrets, in which seats are placed for
the accommodation of visitors, and the terrace with its neat
shrubberies.&nbsp; I must also acknowledge, that the kind
attention of the landlord and his servants deserves the highest
commendation.</p>
<p>The view from the terrace is indescribably beautiful.&nbsp;
The sea lies stretched beneath; the majestic ruins of Harlech
Castle stand upon a rocky base, frowning in solitary grandeur
upon the right; and beyond, the long line of Carnarvonshire hills
projects, like Cambria&rsquo;s lance, forbidding the waves to
make further inroads upon her territories.</p>
<p>Pwllheli and Port Madoc are distinctly visible from this spot;
and the lovers of fine prospects may remain at the Blue Lion for
a week, without wishing to stray further than the terrace in
search of the sublime and beautiful.&nbsp; The continual variety
of light and shadow, with which the mountains are alternately
robed, the freshness of the air, and the solemn majesty of the
ruined fortress, form altogether a volume for the mind to peruse
with intense and unwearied interest.</p>
<h3>HARLECH CASTLE.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p75b.jpg">
<img alt=
"Harlech Castle"
title=
"Harlech Castle"
 src="images/p75s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The present castle was built by Edward the First in 1283, upon
the ruins of one erected by Maelgwn Gwynedd, Prince of North
Wales, in 530.&nbsp; It was seized by the Welsh hero, Owen
Glyndwr, during his struggle for freedom against Henry the
Fourth, and <a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>was retaken, about four years afterwards, by an army
sent by that monarch into Wales.&nbsp; After the defeat of Henry
the Sixth at Northampton, this castle afforded a retreat for his
queen; but being hotly pursued by the Lord Stanley, she was
compelled to fly from hence with great precipitation, leaving her
jewels and other valuables behind her.</p>
<p>In 1468, this place was in possession of Davydd ab Ivan ab
Einion, a man of singular strength and beauty, and of
unconquerable bravery.&nbsp; Being a firm friend to the
Lancastrian line, the Earl William of Pembroke was despatched to
reduce the fortress; and after encountering incredible
difficulties, marching through the very heart of the British
Alps, he at length invested the castle, and committed the
management of the siege to his brother Sir Richard Herbert, a man
equal in size and prowess to the British commandant.&nbsp; The
reply of the Welshman, when called upon to surrender, deserves to
be handed down as a specimen of bravery and loyalty.&nbsp; He had
never acknowledged the sovereignty of Edward; and for nine years
had defied his threats.&nbsp; His answer was in keeping with the
line of conduct he had adopted: &ldquo;Tell your leader,&rdquo;
said he to the messenger, &ldquo;that some years ago I held a
castle in France against its besiegers so long, that all the old
women in Wales talked of me: tell your commander, that I intend
to defend this Welsh castle now, until all the old women in
France shall hear of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Famine, however, at last subdued him; but he <a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>yielded only
upon honourable terms, Sir Richard pledging himself for his
safety.&nbsp; The king at first refused to subscribe to the
conditions; but Sir Richard, with a spirit that cannot be
sufficiently applauded, instantly informed his majesty that he
must take his own life first; for if he lived he would certainly
replace the Welsh chieftain in his strong hold again.&nbsp; The
king was too well acquainted with the value of Sir
Richard&rsquo;s services and scrupulous honour, to persist in his
unjust intentions.&nbsp; He, therefore, ratified the conditions,
and pardoned the chief.&nbsp; But the brave Englishman was soon
after recalled from his military command.</p>
<p>In the civil wars of Charles I. Harlech Castle was the last
that held out for the king, under the command of William Owain,
who surrendered on the 9th of March, 1647.</p>
<p>Upon the side which faces the sea, the castle must have been
impregnable; the walls are scarcely distinguishable from the
rocky base, the whole being a continued surface of dark grey
masonry; and the north and south sides appear nearly as
inaccessible.&nbsp; The gateway upon the eastward side is
situated between two immense rounders, resembling those of Conway
and Carnarvon.&nbsp; The form of the castle is a square, each
side measuring seventy yards, and at each corner is a round
tower; but the turrets that were once attached to them the
unsparing hand of Time has destroyed.&nbsp; Before the entrance
is a deep fosse, cut in the solid <a name="page78"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 78</span>rock; across which a drawbridge was
constructed for security and convenience.</p>
<p>The principal apartments are on the eastward, or entrance,
side of the inner court.&nbsp; The banqueting hall is opposite;
the windows of which look out upon the green surface of the sea;
and, on the right of the court, there formerly stood a small
chapel; the ruins of which are still visible, the pointed windows
remaining entire.&nbsp; It is impossible to conceive a finer view
than is obtained from the towers of Harlech Castle.&nbsp; With a
clear atmosphere, the monarch of the Welsh mountains may be
distinctly seen, towering above his subject hills.&nbsp; The
promontories of Lleyn, and Cricaeth Castle, are likewise objects
of considerable interest; the latter forming a head to a long
neck of land that juts into the sea from the Carnarvonshire
coast, backed by a chain of noble mountains.&nbsp; This castle
likewise owes its foundation to Edward I.</p>
<p>Harlech is one of those places the traveller leaves with
regret, and a feeling that he can never see any so beautiful
again; and from this place to the village of Maentwrog, the road
increases in beauty every mile.</p>
<p>The Bay of Cardigan, expanding to the ocean, lies beneath, on
the left; upon the right, wild rocks and woody hills alternately
diversify the prospect, and, approaching the northern extremity
of the bay, the Traeth Mawr and Traeth B&acirc;ch, two arms of
the sea (the former running up to Port Madoc, and the latter into
the Vale of Maentwrog), are noble objects.</p>
<p><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>The
Traeth B&acirc;ch, bounded by mountains upon either side,
prepares the tourist for the heavenly quietude which reigns
eternally in the bosom of this earthly paradise; and about two
miles from the village, near a farm house called Cemlyn, one of
the most beautiful views of the valley lies stretched before
him.&nbsp; A woody dingle opens on the right, down which the
Velin Rhyd rushes impetuously, mingling its bright waters with
the smoothly meandering Dwyryd, which commingling, flow
gracefully into Cardigan Bay.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>In front, and upon the right of the vale, lies the little
picturesque village of Maentwrog, reposing at the foot of a lofty
mountain.&nbsp; Fine green meadow lands enrich the centre of the
valley, through which the river, like a silver serpent,
&ldquo;drags its slow length along.&rdquo;&nbsp; Upon the
opposite side is seen the mansion of Tan y Bwlch, backed by a
mountain forest, and ornamented by a noble terrace in front, with
pleasure grounds and walks, which the eye loves to rest upon.</p>
<p>The road to Festiniog, at the extreme point of the landscape,
winds up the enclosing hills that fill up the back ground.&nbsp;
To be appreciated, the view must be seen: the most glowing
description would fall incalculably short of the reality.</p>
<p>At this spot I was accosted by a very inquisitive
personage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine evening, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walking far to-day, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A great many gentlemen come from London to see this
valley, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; (trying to shake him off, but it
would not do.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;You come from London, I think, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only because a great many London people come this way,
sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But do not many other travellers come this road, who
are not Londoners?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, sir! but I took you for a Londoner by the cut
of your coat.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve come a long way to-day,
sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have, but how should you know that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the condition of your boots, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a hit I did not anticipate; for, truth to say I was
nearly bootless, at least the <i>soles</i> had nearly left their
<i>bodies</i>, upper leathers I mean, and stood mortally in need
of regeneration; and, as I had not provided myself with a second
pair, thinking they would prove cumbersome in my knapsack, his
remark was felt from toe to heel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll want these repaired, I dare say, sir,
while you remain at the Oakeley Arms&mdash;comfortable
inn&mdash;capital beds, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why I think I shall, my friend; perhaps you can
recommend me to a cobbler, in the village yonder,&rdquo;
(pointing to Maentwrog.)</p>
<p><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>&ldquo;I am a boot maker, sir, in the village, and have
cobbled, as you are pleased to call it, the soles of all
strangers in need, for the last twenty years.&nbsp; My father
performed that office before me; and I may say my all (awl) of
life depends upon the gentlemen who visit our beautiful
valley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not employed then by the inhabitants of your
native village?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>was</i>, sir; but a new comer, who wrote over his
door &lsquo;leather cutter,&rsquo; cut me out; for I never found
business enough to set up a shop, and so, sir, I am obliged to
watch for customers, to keep up my trade.&nbsp; Those boots of
yours, sir, will give me dinners for half the week, if you will
only let me give them welts, soles, and heel-taps.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ve got a fine foot, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This piece of gross flattery did not prevent my telling him to
follow me to the inn, and receive the reward of his perseverance
and industry.</p>
<h3>THE OAKELEY ARMS.&nbsp; TAN Y BWLCH.</h3>
<p>I was tired, and gladly resigned my dilapidated boots to the
care of my <i>soles&rsquo;</i> physician; who, with a most
respectful bow, promised to let me have them by eight
o&rsquo;clock on the following morning.</p>
<p>Oh the comforts of a clean room, clean sheets, and a good
bed!&nbsp; These I experienced at the Oakeley Arms; and I arose
refreshed, and eager to commence my walk; but I was doomed to
disappointment, for on <a name="page82"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 82</span>drawing up the blind of my window, a
dark and dismal morning presented itself, the rain falling in
torrents, and the lovely valley transformed into a gloomy gorge
of rolling clouds.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s to be done? thought I; jump
into bed again, answered my careful spirit.&nbsp; I obeyed the
suggestion, and slept another hour, when I again awoke, and on
inspection found the day still melancholy and tearful.</p>
<p>I descended to the breakfast room, and by the time I had
finished that necessary meal the sun shone out gloriously.&nbsp;
Having discharged my bill, and paid the loquacious cobbler for
repairing my boots, I proceeded to view the grounds of Tan y
Bwlch, the seat of Mrs. Oakeley.&nbsp; The name signifies
&ldquo;Below the Pass;&rdquo; it is situated on the side of a
hill which overlooks the vale.</p>
<p>From the terrace of this mansion you command one of the most
romantic views in Wales.&nbsp; Harlech Castle is visible upon the
right; the Merionethshire mountains tower in the distance, and
the entire valley, from Festiniog to Traeth Bychan, watered by
the river Dwyryd, is interesting beyond description.&nbsp; Lord
Lyttleton tells us, in his observations upon this valley, that an
honest Welsh farmer, who died there at 105 years of age, had by
his first wife thirty children, ten by his second, and four by
his third.&nbsp; His eldest son was eighty-one years older than
his youngest, and 800 persons, descended from his body, attended
his funeral.</p>
<p><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>I
should be doing injustice to the worthy landlord of the Maentwrog
Inn, whose house I used upon my second visit to this delightful
valley, did I not speak in praise of his attention to the
comforts of all travellers.&nbsp; Good beds, civil waiters,
excellent fare, and cheap charges, render this one of the very
best inns in Wales.&nbsp; And hear, ye lingering tourists! you
may have bed and board for the inconsiderable sum of one guinea
per week, which I think a very considerable temptation to remain
at it a month, for there is sufficient in the neighbourhood to
interest the most phlegmatic of Adam&rsquo;s progeny.&nbsp; From
hence may be visited the following interesting places.&nbsp; The
village of Festiniog, three miles, where there are two good inns,
the Pengwern Arms, and the Newborough Arms, where post horses and
cars are always in readiness; there is also a good boarding-house
kept by Miss Owen.&nbsp; The Falls of Cynvael, two and a half;
the slate quarries, five and a half; the cataracts of the Rhaiadr
Du and Ravenfall, two miles; Llyn Llyanyrch, three and a half,
where the trout are excellent; Cwmorddin Pool, lies to the
northward, about four and a half miles, to which the tourist may
be conducted by the railroad.&nbsp; There is a house at each end
of the lake where the angler will find accommodation from the
hospitable owners for a trifling remuneration.&nbsp; Llyn Mannod
contains very large trout, and is six miles from Maentwrog, and
Llyn Morwynion is about the same distance.</p>

</a></p>
<p><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>I
proceeded along the lower road by the north side of the salts, as
the inhabitants of the valley call the arm of the sea, which here
has the appearance of a lake begirt with mountains, craggy
cliffs, and shadowing woods.&nbsp; Here I bade adieu to the
delightful valley of Festiniog, and after walking about four
miles along a pleasant road, a noble sheet of water met my eyes,
which appeared to be hemmed in by inaccessible mountains,
differing in form from those I had left behind, being more
conical, and some shooting upwards like pyramids into the
clouds.</p>
<p>As I proceeded I discovered it to be the Traeth Mawr, which,
as the sea is hidden from us by a breakwater, has the appearance
of a broad lake.</p>
<p>Upon this breakwater, which extends across the bay, is a
railroad which conveys slates from the quarries at Festiniog to
Port Madoc, where it is calculated ten thousand tons are shipped
annually.&nbsp; Port Madoc receives its name from the late
William Alexander Maddocks, Esq., of Tan-yr-allt, as does the
town of Tremadoc.</p>
<p>The extraordinary efforts of this enterprising man caused him
to be looked up to as the Prince of the soil.&nbsp; He redeemed,
by constructing an embankment of nearly one mile in length from
north to south, across the Traeth Mawr, at the eastern extremity
of Cardigan Bay, a tract of more than 2,700 acres of land.&nbsp;
This enterprise was completed in 1811, and cost upwards of
&pound;100,000; so that, with the lands previously <a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>recovered, no
less than 7000 acres have been regained, 6000 of which are
cultivated.</p>
<p>The view from the breakwater is perhaps the finest in North
Wales for distant mountain scenery.&nbsp; When the tourist has
reached the centre of it, let him turn his back upon the sea, and
upon his right he will perceive a hill, called Pl&acirc;s Newydd,
from which a range of Alpine scenery stretches up to the monarch
of Snowdonia, who towers pre-eminent in the distance.&nbsp; Upon
his left another range, commencing with a hill called Moel y
G&ecirc;st, leads up to the same grand object, and the
extraordinary variety displayed in the formation of these
wonderful masses with the varying lights and shadows that adorn
them with sunny crowns or misty mantles, produces a sublimity of
effect I never before experienced.&nbsp; A bridge joins the
breakwater to the quay at Port Madoc, under which the tide rushes
with great impetuosity, covering a vast extent of ground at the
flood, which is left nearly dry at the ebb.&nbsp; Proceeding
along the road, in a short time the tourist obtains a peep at the
little town of Tremadoc; but before reaching it he perceives the
church, an elegant building, with a tower and lofty spire, which
forms a principal object in the landscape.&nbsp; The archway,
under which the church is approached, is a beautiful specimen of
workmanship, and does equal credit to the taste of the founder
and execution of the builder.&nbsp; Divine service is read here
in the English language every Sunday, which is a great
accommodation to the English families, <a name="page86"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 86</span>residing in the neighbourhood, as
there is no other church within twenty miles where it is so
performed.</p>
<h3>TREMADOC,</h3>
<p>or the town of Madoc, is built quadrangularly, and in the
centre of the square is a column with a pedestal, round which are
twelve steps.&nbsp; On the eastern side is a commodious market
house, above which are the assembly rooms.&nbsp; A market is held
here on Fridays, and the Barmouth and Carnarvon coach passes
through three times a-week.</p>
<p>Having refreshed myself with a luncheon of cold meat and a
salad, I trudged off, in spite of wind and weather, which
threatened a speedy commencement of hostilities.&nbsp; Large
masses of vapoury clouds were driving over head; the swallows
skimmed the surface of the river, and brushed the standing corn
with their swift wings, as they flew along in the pursuit of
their prey; and the wind blew loud and shrilly, as in the month
of November.&nbsp; At a short distance from the town, upon the
Beddgelert road, is a lofty hill, the base of which is planted
with fir trees, through which a path winds up to the mansion of
Tan-yr-Allt, the late beautiful residence of Mr. Maddocks.&nbsp;
I had not proceeded far when I was compelled to seek shelter in a
hollow, of which there are many at the feet of the enormous
precipices which overhang the road.</p>
<p>The transient storm having passed away, and sunshine once more
lighting up the valley, I again <a name="page87"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 87</span>pushed forward.&nbsp; The
Merionethshire mountains upon the right, decked in their
countless hues of rock and heather, over which the departing
storm swept with its rolling clouds, in dark magnificence, formed
a noble subject for the artist&rsquo;s pencil.&nbsp; The road is
elevated above the meadows which enrich the centre of the vale;
and the river, which flows through them, having risen above its
banks, and spread itself over a considerable tract of country,
resembled an extensive lake.</p>
<p>About half way between Tremadoc and Beddgelert, is a small
dingle upon the left of the road, with a neat lodge at the
entrance, and a path leading up to the shrubbery, beneath which a
mountain stream flows rapidly, and empties itself into the
Dwyryd.&nbsp; As I proceeded, numerous falls dashed down the
mountains, and plunging into hollows underneath the road, emerged
again upon the other side, I was several times forced to take
shelter from the heavy showers under fallen blocks of rock; and
once, as the storm abated, and I looked anxiously out to see if
it was clear enough to pursue my journey, a glorious rainbow
stretched across the valley, its points resting upon the
mountains on either side.&nbsp; I now proceeded at a rapid pace,
and the river became more deep and narrow, and the circling
eddies, as they floated down the stream, announced that I was
approaching the fall of a great body of water when
suddenly&mdash;whizz, whirr, clash, splash, dash, astounding and
astonishing&mdash;</p>
<h3><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>ABER
GLAS LYN</h3>
<p>with all its world of horrors, burst at once upon the
view.&nbsp; I felt a tremulous sensation within, me; a
contraction of the muscles of my throat; an hysterical sob and a
desire to weep.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;White foaming, thundering, falls the
boiling flood;<br />
Rocks clash, and echo mocks the horrid din,<br />
While man appalled, stands breathless, in amaze,<br />
And, filled with awe, exalts his thoughts to Him,<br />
Who was, who is, and aye must be supreme!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just above the bridge is a semi-circular rock, which forms a
salmon leap, over which the salmon, at spawning time, first lodge
themselves at the height of five or six yards.&nbsp; Proceeding
through the pass, at every step new wonders met the eye.&nbsp;
The late heavy rains had swollen the mountain waterfalls, and
caused a terrific torrent to roar and struggle through a narrow
channel; for the mountains, forming this southern end of the
vale, approach so near to each other, that they only afford a
contracted flow for the river, and a narrow road, while their
rocky sides rise so perpendicularly, that their summits are
scarcely farther distant from each other than their
foundations.&nbsp; The rushing river was a pure sheet of white;
furious, uncontrollable; nothing but the immense blocks riven
from the mountain&rsquo;s craggy sides could withstand its
dreadful impetuosity.&nbsp; A few stunted fir and larch trees at
the commencement of the pass were seen starting from the dark
clefts upon either side, which threw a deeper shade upon this
awful valley.</p>

calls this pass &ldquo;the noblest specimen of the <i>finely
horrid</i> the eye can possibly behold.&nbsp; The poet,&rdquo; he
continues, &ldquo;has not described, nor the painter pictured so
gloomy a retreat.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis the last approach to the
mansion of Pluto, through the regions of Despair.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
could have stopped for hours to admire this splendid example of
the sublimity of Nature, but time pressed, so I pushed on to
Beddgelert which is not more than a mile and a half from the
bridge.&nbsp; A solitary mountain ash which grows about half way
up the pass, is the sole bright thing in this abode of terror,
and looks like Beauty in desolation.&nbsp; Emerging from the pass
there is a stone which is called the chair of Rhys G&ocirc;ch
o&rsquo;r Eryri; a famous mountain bard who lived in the time of
Owen Glyndwr.&nbsp; He resided at the entrance into the Traeth
Mawr Sands, from whence he used to walk, and sitting upon this
stone compose his poems.&nbsp; He died in 1420, at the advanced
age of 120 years; he was a gentleman of property, and was buried
in the ancient priory at</p>
<h3>BEDDGELERT.</h3>
<p>Some are of opinion that this word should be written Celert,
or Cilert, Bedd-Cilert, or Cilert&rsquo;s Grave; supposing that a
monk or saint of that name was buried here.&nbsp; Another
celebrated bard was entombed at this place, named Davydd Nanmor,
who died about the year 1460.</p>
<p>The Goat is an excellent inn, and every attention <a
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>the traveller
can desire is paid with the greatest celerity.&nbsp; Twenty post
horses are kept at this inn for travellers, and eight or ten
ponies for the accommodation of those visitors who wish to ascend
Snowdon with ease and safety.</p>
<p>At nine o&rsquo;clock, I strolled from the inn to the
bridge.&nbsp; It was a lovely evening; there was no moon, but the
clear sky displayed its burning host in beautiful array.&nbsp; No
breath of air disturbed the silent slumbers of the peaceful
woods.&nbsp; The lull of rippling waters alone struck upon the
ear, yielding a solemn tone like the deep swell of the organ,
breaking upon the deepest solitude.</p>
<p>In such a situation how indescribable is the feeling which
takes possession of us!&nbsp; What language can express, what
tongue can utter it!&nbsp; My very breathing seemed to disturb
the excessive sweetness of nature&rsquo;s melody.</p>
<p>In a field near the church yard are two grey stones overhung
with bushes, pointing out the grave of &ldquo;Gelert,&rdquo;
Llewelyn&rsquo;s hound.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the following morning I quitted
the inn, where every attention was shown that a traveller could
desire, and proceeded over the Ivy bridge, through which the
Gwynant flowed, deep and smooth as glass, without an obstruction
to ruffle its clear waters, that glided along, kissing its
verdant banks, like the stream of a happy life.&nbsp; Quietude
reigned in this region uninterrupted.&nbsp; About half a mile
from Beddgelert, a rocky eminence projects into the road, called
Vortigern&rsquo;s Hill, or Dinas Emrys, a magician, who was sent
for to this place by Vortigern, when he found himself hated by
his subjects, <a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>and fled from their just anger to this secluded
spot.&nbsp; Passing this memorable place, a round clump of rock
attracts the eye, rising as it were in the centre of the valley,
and called Moel Wyn.&nbsp; Looking backward, Moel Hebog, the Hawk
Hill, rises majestically and closes up the entrance to
Beddgelert.&nbsp; Moel Siabod towers in front, and, as we pursued
our delightful path about two miles and a half from Beddgelert,
an opening of the hills upon the left displayed a deep gorge, and
the base of Snowdon, whose high peak, rising in the unclouded
skies, held up the holy symbol of Christianity, as if in
adoration of the Creator.&nbsp; At length I reached Llyn Dinas, a
lake of about three quarters of a mile in extent, through which
the Gwynant runs; it is surrounded by lofty mountains of a deeper
tint than is usually seen upon the Welsh hills.&nbsp; A
beautifully situated cottage here at the far end of the lake,
belonging to Mr. Sampson, nestles among the protecting woods, and
forms a delightful object.&nbsp; The river which feeds the lake,
winds through the verdant and undulating grounds which form a
miniature park between the cottage and the lake.&nbsp; Following
up the course of the stream, I left Llyn Dinas behind me, and
proceeded by a gradual ascent through the most delightful scenery
I ever beheld, until I caught glimpses through the plantations
of</p>
<h3>LLYN GWYNANT,</h3>
<p>and after a while beheld it stretching beneath me upon <a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>my left
hand.&nbsp; The valley forms a bowl among the hills.&nbsp; The
bottom is a small grassy plain, dotted with trees, which has
obtained the appellation of Beauty sleeping in the lap of
Terror.&nbsp; The mountains that surround the vale have a wild
and rugged appearance.&nbsp; As I proceeded along the road
towards the head of the valley, a horn was sounded from the
mountain, and I perceived a Welsh girl standing upon a projecting
eminence: bare headed and bare footed was this nymph of Cambria;
her cheeks were swelled out with her occupation, and she looked
like a female Boreas, bursting with the wind she was sending
forth by degrees to alarm the world.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p93b.jpg">
<img alt=
"Snowdon, from the Pass of Llyn Gwynant"

"Snowdon, from the Pass of Llyn Gwynant"
 src="images/p93s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>She eyed me with glances of curiosity all the while, and I
thought she could perhaps give me some information about the
valley, which might be interesting; so quitting the direct road,
I scrambled up the hill side, and asked her the meaning of her
sounding the horn so loudly?&nbsp; But she either did not, or
would not, understand me; and after vainly endeavouring to
extract anything from her, I quietly sat myself down, delighted
by the splendid view beneath me.</p>
<p>Having nearly reached the extremity of this valley, I gazed,
from my elevated situation, upon the dark and perpendicular rocks
on the opposite side; and towering in the air immediately over
the centre of the valley was a hawk with expanded wings,
apparently motionless.&nbsp; Presently it rose a little higher,
but without the slightest visible exertion, then stooped again,
<a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>mounted
once more, and, as fast as the eye could follow, swept round the
huge buttresses of sharp ridged cliffs, that hang over the
entrance of the Pass of Llanberis.</p>
<p>As Llyn Gwynant is gradually shut out from the lingering gaze
of the traveller, (who, it may be said, during the whole of the
ascent, should turn his eyes behind him,) and he at length looks
forward in the direction of Llanberis, a new scene of grandeur
bursts upon him.&nbsp; He has left beauty behind in its loveliest
form;&mdash;but the sublime and wonderful now call forth all the
springs of admiration.</p>
<p>Snowdon again appears in all his splendour!&nbsp; Mountains
that by comparison looked like hillocks rise round his regal
waist, in groups numerous and picturesque.&nbsp; The deep black
crags that form the western side of the valley make a magnificent
fore-ground, and open here like nature&rsquo;s gates, to disclose
the secrets of her bosom.&nbsp; The accompanying etching gives an
admirable idea of this imposing scene.&nbsp; About a mile from
hence is a place called Gwrydd, where there is a small public
house, with a sign signifying nothing.&nbsp; Here I resolved to
&ldquo;rough it&rdquo; for a day, intending to fish the lakes,
situated immediately above this spot, as nature&rsquo;s cisterns
to water the pleasant valleys.</p>
<p>The public house possesses a small parlour, carpeted, with
half a dozen hair-bottomed chairs, and a mahogany table.&nbsp; A
silent but most importunate monitor urged me to discover what
food this mountain chalet could <a name="page95"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 95</span>produce.&nbsp; &ldquo;Eggs and
bacon,&rdquo; was the expected reply to my question; and I soon
had the pleasure of seeing this humble, but most grateful, fare
placed before me, and in spite of the indifferent style of the
cooking, I partook of it eagerly, having that incomparable sauce
&ldquo;a good appetite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After I had repaired my broken rod, I ascended the mountain at
the back of the house, and arrived at a large oval lake, in which
the black and sterile rocks that form inaccessible ramparts on
one side are reflected in its generally unruffled surface.&nbsp;
The scene is wild and desolate, such as Despair herself would
select for her abode.&nbsp; There are plenty of fish in this
lake, but they are all small and extremely shy.&nbsp; I remained
upon its margin until the shadows of night gave me warning to
attend to my safety, and make the best of my way to my lodging,
where I speedily ascended by a ladder-like staircase to a kind of
cock-loft, which was divided into two compartments, one for the
accommodation of the family, man, wife, children, and servants,
the other fitted up for travellers.&nbsp; Sleep soon overtook me,
and I should have continued to sleep, I have no doubt, until
breakfast time, had I not been awakened by a trifling
accident</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;At the mid hour of night, when stars were
weeping,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and ghosts of the mighty walk upon the hills, with a variety
of other interesting objects that poets and nursery-maids have
described infinitely better than I can pretend to do, I was
visited by a dream in which <a name="page96"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 96</span>the ghost of a lobster popped his
head out of a salad bowl, and demanded upon what authority I had
presumed to make mince-meat of his body, when a loud crash roused
me from my slumber, and I found myself, with my knees doubled up
to my chin, upon the floor; the bedstead having broken in the
middle, and deposited me in this unenviable position.&nbsp; I
need not say that for the remaining part of the night I was
wholly left to waking reveries, and uncontrollable desires for
the blessings of daylight, which at last greeted my longing eyes,
and hurrying on my clothes, I descended, and walked forth to
scent the morning air in the direction of Llanberis.&nbsp; The
mists rolled like troubled lakes in the valleys, and the black
bleak rocks looked cheerless and forbidding.&nbsp; The breeze was
keen and piercing, and I started at a round pace to get myself
warm by exercise.&nbsp; Having reached the summit of the roadway,
I plunged at once into the pass of Llanberis, wild and
gloomy.&nbsp; The precipices on my left looked truly terrible,
like the shadow of death wrapped in a vapoury shroud.&nbsp; This
pass is above four miles in length, and is a fine specimen of
rugged grandeur.&nbsp; Not a single tree enlivens with its
verdure this tremendous chasm.&nbsp; Range above range of rocks
tower over the traveller upon either side, bearing various tints
of black, brown, green, and purple, according to the disposition
of the sun&rsquo;s rays, and the distances of the ponderous
masses.&nbsp; The rocks on both sides are nearly perpendicular;
and, about two <a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
97</span>miles down the pass, the tourist will perceive some
prodigious masses of rock upon his right hand that have fallen
from the overhanging cliffs, which, when he pauses to look upon,
will strike a feeling of terror into his heart, as he inwardly
exclaims, &ldquo;could any one have witnessed the descent of this
tremendous mass?&rdquo;&nbsp; The accompanying sketch gives a
most accurate description.</p>

</a></p>
<p>We soon obtained a view of the lakes that spread themselves
before us&mdash;viz.: Llyn Peris and Llyn Padarn, with the
romantic castle of Dolbadarn upon its rocky promontory.&nbsp; On
issuing from a pass on our left, as I was informed, is a valuable
copper mine, and a stream of water conveyed over the road, by the
aid of a wooden conduit, into the lake, which stream was for the
use of the mine.</p>
<p>At length, I reached the inn, called Victoria, ordered
breakfast, and procured an admittance to the Castle of
Dolbadarn.&nbsp; This ancient fortress is supposed to have been
built by one Padarn Beisrudd ab Idwal, for the purpose of
guarding the mountain pass which I had just quitted.&nbsp; A
single round tower is all that remains of the castle, although
traces are left of a much more extensive building.&nbsp; Here
Owen G&ocirc;ch was imprisoned twenty years by his brother
Llewelyn, the last Prince of Wales of the British line; and an
ode is still extant, written by Howel Voel, wherein his captivity
is affectionately lamented.</p>
<p><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>The
view from the castle is truly sublime, comprising the two lakes,
and the tremendous range of mountains, that seem to admit of no
outlet from the vale.&nbsp; But the most beautiful prospect is
from the lake in front of the promontory on which the castle
stands, and is reflected in the smooth waters beneath, while the
majestic Snowdon towers in the distance.</p>
<p>Returning to the Victoria, I partook of the refreshments
provided, and then retracing my steps, I visited the little
rustic church of Llanberis, which, for its simplicity, is well
worthy of attention.&nbsp; Upon entering the doorway, there is a
small stone font placed upon a pedestal which is approached by
three stone steps: it resembles a small washing tub, and its
cover is much like a copper-lid.&nbsp; Advancing into the
interior, the music loft is upon the left, under which is a
dilapidated screen, opposite to the font.&nbsp; A doorway in the
centre of the screen leads into the body of the church, where
ancient oaken benches are ranged upon either side, and the pulpit
and communion table are immediately in front.&nbsp; The old
arched roof is held together by iron pins, which project on each
side of the timbers, and the whole interior is whitewashed.&nbsp;
The only pew in the church adjoins the communion table, both of
which have suffered materially by the worm and time.&nbsp; The
few monuments in this simple structure are upon small slate
slabs, about the size of a school-boy&rsquo;s, and are hung up on
the wooden beams.</p>
<p>On leaving the church, there is a monumental slate <a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>slab on the
left of the path, bearing the following inscription and
verses:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">Underneath<br />

Of John, the son of<br />
Robert Closs, who was<br />
Interred Decr. 1st,<br />
1805, aged 7 years.</p>

A dychryniad dechreunos.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Upon returning to my inn at Gwrydd, I discovered that the
landlady was sister to little John Closs; and from her I learnt
the story of his melancholy fate.&nbsp; It is as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>John was a pretty boy, about seven years of age, with fair
hair and blue eyes, of a sweet temper, adored by his parents, and
loving them most affectionately in return.&nbsp; Indeed little
John Closs was the talk of the parish, and held up as a pattern
of filial love and reverence to all the children in the
village.&nbsp; His uncle had a small farm at Nant Bettws; and
John&rsquo;s father having sent him to reside there for a few
months, the fond mother would often cross the mountain to see her
son and her sister, returning home in the evening of the same
day.&nbsp; Little John got tired of living away from home, and
one night, after his mother had quitted <a
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>the cottage
to return to Llanberis, he wept so bitterly, and prayed so
earnestly to be permitted to follow her home, that the good
people at Bettws permitted him to try and overtake her, which
they considered he might easily do, as she had not left the house
ten minutes before he started.</p>
<p>The mother reached Llanberis in safety; but the poor boy lost
his way in a snow storm on Moel Einion, and was not heard of for
more than a week afterwards; when, one day, a man crossing the
mountain, found the child stretched on the ground in a slumbering
position, his face towards the earth, buried in his hands, and
quite dead.</p>
<p>The following morning, I proceeded towards Capel Curig, but
this road is very uninteresting.&nbsp; The tourist is, however,
amply gratified, if it happen to be tolerably clear weather, on
his arrival at an ancient stone bridge which crosses a stream
that tumbles over some black rocks on the right, and winds its
way in graceful variety, forming a pleasing spot to rest
upon.&nbsp; Looking back towards Llanberis, the mountain scenery
is very fine; and I here took my farewell look of Snowdon arid
Snowdonia.</p>
<h3>CAPEL CURIG,</h3>
<p>is in the parish of Llandegai.&nbsp; It derives its name from
a man who was canonized, and founded a chapel in this mountainous
region.&nbsp; He was the son of Llawdden Lluyddog, of
Edinburgh.&nbsp; There are here two <a name="page101"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 101</span>lakes, and some tolerable fishing
may be had, if you take a boat; but from the banks it is quite
useless to attempt it.&nbsp; From this spot, excursions may be
made to Llanberis, and</p>
<h3>MOEL SIABOD,</h3>
<p>from the summit of which a magnificent view is obtained of the
mountains of Snowdonia, of nine different lakes, and the sea
beyond Carnarvon.&nbsp; The distance from the inn to the apex of
the mountain does not exceed three miles and a half.</p>
<h3>DOLWYDDELAN CASTLE,</h3>
<p>situated about five miles from Capel Curig, and on the
eastward side of Moel Siabod, deserves notice.&nbsp; It is built
upon a lofty rock, which on one side is inaccessible.&nbsp; There
are two square towers, and a court in the middle.&nbsp; It is
surrounded by mountains, and must in ancient days have been a
fortress of considerable importance.&nbsp; It is said, Llewelyn
the Great was born in the castle; and this fact is sufficient to
interest the stranger who is capable of appreciating and feeling
reverence for a hero, who so long struggled with unwearied
assiduity and unconquerable bravery for his native land, and who
fought and died in the sacred cause of liberty.</p>
<p>Within four miles of Capel Curig is an oval lake, of about
three miles in circumference, called Llyn Ogwen which must by no
means be overlooked.&nbsp; The scenery <a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>around is
delightful and the waters are well stored with excellent trout of
fine flavour, and surpassing all others in that respect, in the
Carnarvonshire lakes.</p>
<p>At the western end of this lake, are the Falls of Benglog,
(being three in number and upwards of one hundred feet in height)
from whence the waters take their course through Beavers&rsquo;
Hollow, a wild and romantic glen, rocky and barren.</p>
<p>Powell, in his History of North Wales, says, &ldquo;In Tevi,
above all the rivers in Wales, were, in Giraldus&rsquo;s time, a
great number of castells, which may be Englished beavers, and are
called in Welsh avanc, which name onlie remaineth in Wales at
this day, but what it is, very few can tell.&nbsp; It is a beast
not much unlike an otter, but that it is bigger, all hearie
saving the taile, which is like a fish taile as broad as a
man&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; This beast useth as well the water as the
land; and hath a voice, sharp teeth, and biteth cruellie till he
perceives the bones cracke. * * * * He that will learn what
strong nests they make, which Giraldus calleth castells, which
they build upon the face of the water with great bowes, which
they cut with their teeth, and how some lie upon their backs
holding the wood with their fore feet, which the other draweth
with a crosse stick, the which he holdeth in his mouth, to the
water&rsquo;s side, and other particularities of their natures,
let him read Giraldus in his Topographie of Wales.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this stream are found the fresh water muscle, which the
country people call <i>cregyn diluw</i>, i.e. <i>shells</i> <a
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span><i>of the
deluge</i>, supposed to have been brought into it by Noah&rsquo;s
flood.</p>
<p>On the left of the lake are the Crags of Trivaen, huge
shattered ridges, which overhang the pool and keep it in
continual shadow, while the sides of Braich-ddu slope gradually
to the lake&rsquo;s margin.&nbsp; The Francon Mountains, in the
distance, are astonishing, and altogether this lake scene may be
considered the finest in Carnarvonshire.</p>
<p>A gentleman, in the winter of 1831, was driving along the road
which skirts the borders of the lake, when upwards of a thousand
tons of rock fell from the heights of Benglog, a little below the
Falls, into Nant Francon, a short time after he had passed them,
and he beheld one portion roll into the valley and river, while
the other rested upon the road he had just travelled, rendering
it impossible for any carriage to proceed by that route, until
the obstruction was removed.</p>
<p>A mile distant from Llyn Ogwen is another lake, well worthy of
being visited, which lies in a deep hollow of the Glyder
Mountains, called</p>
<h3>LLYN IDWAL,</h3>
<p>where the gloomy horror of the scenery is most appalling;
particularly the terrific chasm of Twll Du, or the Black
Cleft.&nbsp; This spot derived its name from the following crime
which was perpetrated here.</p>
<p>Prince Owain Gwynedd, who reigned in the twelfth century, had
a favourite called Nevydd Hardd, to whose care he intrusted his
son Idwal, and who betraying his <a name="page104"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 104</span>trust, commanded his son Dunawt to
destroy the young prince, a crime which he too faithfully obeyed,
perpetrating the cruel deed at this place.&nbsp; But, being
discovered, Nevydd and his posterity were degraded from the rank
of nobles to bondsmen, and Rhun, the son of Dunawt, who again
became possessed of the property of his ancestors, granted the
ground upon which the Church of Llanrwst now stands, as an
expiatory gift for the foul crime imputed to his father.&nbsp;
The grave of Idwal is still pointed out by the inhabitants, close
to the lake.</p>
<p>The scenery around is well calculated to inspire fear in the
timid, as being adapted to the committal of atrocity of any
kind.&nbsp; Bleak, black, desolate, and stern, it thrills the
beholder with an indescribable sensation of terror.</p>
<p>The lake is well stored with fish, of a darker colour than
those in the Ogwen, and of a less delicate flavour.&nbsp; These
lakes are in the parish of Llan Tegai, so called from its patron
saint Tegai, the son of Ithel Hael, a nobleman of Armorica,
brother to Credivael and Flewin, who built Penmynydd and
Llanflewin, in Anglesey, about the year 636.&nbsp; <i>See
Rowland&rsquo;s Mona Antiqua Rest</i>. <i>p.</i> 189.</p>
<p>After a delightful day&rsquo;s ramble amongst this wild and
sublime scenery, I returned to the inn at Capel Curig, and on the
following morning took the road to Llanrwst, which in a short
time becomes particularly interesting.&nbsp; The dark and
comfortless sterility is <a name="page105"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 105</span>exchanged for a delightful valley,
with luxuriant woods, which stretch to the summit of the hills
upon either side; and near the two mile stone is one of the most
picturesque cottages imaginable, placed on the side of a hill
above the bridge, which crosses the river Llugwy, and gives
additional beauty to the romantic dell.</p>
<p>Half a mile beyond is an Observatory, which stands upon the
highest point of a towering cliff, a portion of whose summit is
clothed with purple heath, and the remainder presents a face of
grey barren rock, while beneath a forest of rich foliage creeps
from its base far up the craggy sides.</p>
<p>Within a mile of this place are the celebrated waterfalls,
called</p>
<h3>RHAIADR Y WENNOL,</h3>
<p>i.e. the Cataract of the Swallow&mdash;a fall of about sixty
feet in width.&nbsp; The river, at the top of the first fall,
flows in an unbroken sheet, but soon becomes dispersed in various
streams that dash and struggle through the impending masses of
rock, charming the ear with their complicated roar.&nbsp; At the
second fall, it rushes in a collected volume into the boiling
vortex, from whence, at the third, it is dispersed in
spray.&nbsp; A small wicket gate by the road side, leads to a
footpath through the grounds to the Falls, where the visitor
cannot fail to find an adequate reward for his digression.&nbsp;
The old oak trees that overhang the ravine are beautifully
grouped.&nbsp; On one side, a large rock rises <a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
106</span>perpendicularly nearly 500 feet, and the earth is
clothed with velvet moss and decked with wild flowers.&nbsp;
Fancy would picture just such a retreat, for a wandering sylph!
while the rays of light, darting through the greenwoods, remind
us of the flittings of Sir John Wynne&rsquo;s ghost, which was
said to haunt this glen for many years, but is now laid at rest
in the depths of the Lower Fall.&nbsp; Journeying onward, I
reached the village of</p>
<h3>BETTWS Y COED,</h3>
<p>which, being translated, is the Station in the Wood; and a
most delightful station it is.&nbsp; The Shrewsbury and Holyhead
road runs through it, and the junction of the Llugwy and the
Conwy rivers is at no great distance.&nbsp; The church is a
venerable structure, and contains an old monument, erected to the
memory of Gruffydd, the son of David G&ocirc;ch, who was a
natural son of David, the brother of Llewelyn, the last Prince of
Wales.&nbsp; He died in the fourteenth century, and a stone
statue of him is in a recess on the north side of the church,
with this inscription: &ldquo;Hic jacet Gruffydd ap Davyd
G&ocirc;ch, agnus Dei miserere mei.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At about a mile from Bettws is an iron bridge of one arch,
which carries the Holyhead road over the river Conwy.&nbsp; Its
span is 105 feet, and it is called the Waterloo Bridge, from its
having been erected in the year that tremendous battle was
fought.&nbsp; But the principal object is</p>
<h3><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>PONT-Y-PAIR,</h3>
<p>the Bridge of the Caldron.&nbsp; It has four arches, and the
natural rock supplies it with piers, that seem to defy the
efforts of time or the fury of the waters.&nbsp; Immediately
above the bridge is the fall and salmon-leap.&nbsp; The river
rolls and plunges into a deep reservoir below.&nbsp; The grandeur
of the scene during the floods, I was informed, surpasses
imagination, and unfortunately for me, the heat of the sun had
dried them up, when I visited this celebrated spot.</p>
<p>For this bridge the inhabitants are indebted to one Howell, a
mason, who resided at Penllyn in the year 1468; and having
occasion to attend the assizes at Conway, he was unexpectedly
prevented from passing the Lleder by the fury of the flood.&nbsp;
That a similar disappointment might not occur to others, he
erected a wooden bridge across that river, and trusted to the
generosity of travellers to remunerate him.&nbsp; The success of
this attempt encouraged him to erect the bridge at Bettws y Coed,
which is now called Pont y Pair, but he died before it was
completed.</p>
<p>Upon the right of this bridge is Carreg y Gwalch, or the Rock
of the Falcon, well clothed with trees, through which the bald
cliffs peep, like a body of sharp shooters from a brush wood
anxious to escape detection.&nbsp; In this rock is a recess
called the Cave of Shenkin, a celebrated outlaw, who found
shelter here from the unremitting efforts of justice during the
reign of Edward IV.&nbsp; It is blocked up by a piece of
rock.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Within</span> half a mile from the town of
Llanrwst is</p>
<h3>GWYDIR CASTLE,</h3>
<p>the property of Lord Willoughby d&rsquo;Eresby, a family
mansion of no very attractive appearance.&nbsp; It is situated on
the right of the road which winds between it and a lofty
wood-clad precipice, called Carreg y Gwalch, or the Rock of the
Falcon.&nbsp; It was built by John Wynne ab Meredydd, in 1555,
and has lately undergone some alteration.&nbsp; The breakfast
parlour contains a curious carving of the arms of the Gwydir
family, supported by Julius C&aelig;sar and Augustus; the former
holding his commentaries in one hand, and his sword in the other;
the latter, his sword only.&nbsp; The dining room has some
specimens of carving, that are worthy of <a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>observation; but throughout the mansion there is very
little of what belonged to it originally.&nbsp; The chairs,
panelling, and even tables, being coloured for the purpose of
giving the apartments the appearance of antique splendour, which,
until lately, they wanted.</p>
<p>The drawing-room is spacious and lofty, and is lighted by a
double row of windows, which gives it a heavy look: this unusual
arrangement was caused by the removal of the dormitory, to give
height to this room.&nbsp; Over the fire-place is a finely
executed carving of Julius C&aelig;sar in oak.&nbsp; At the N.W.
end of the room, a piece of tapestry represents a vintage, and at
the S.E. another specimen of needlework commemorates the landing
of Charles the Fifth at Grenada.</p>
<p>The coronation chair of George the Second is shewn in this
apartment, and the footstool used by Queen Caroline on her trial
at Westminster Hall.&nbsp; There is a centre table, very richly
ornamented with carved work; and another, which in shape exactly
resembles the slab and pedestal of a tombstone, so that the
visitor naturally enough walks up to it, expecting to see the
customary &ldquo;Hic jacet,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
<p>The cradle of Sir Richard Wynne, bearing the date of 1634,
completes the list of curiosities contained in this room.</p>
<p>The garden, which is extensive, contains some valuable plants
and shrubs, and the terrace is a pleasant promenade, sloping from
which are beds of beautiful flowers, of various classes and
descriptions.&nbsp; After <a name="page110"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 110</span>satisfying the housekeeper with a
trifling gratuity, I proceeded to Llanrwst, but halted upon the
bridge to take a view of the Conwy, (over which beautiful river
its arches expand) and the town to which it leads.&nbsp; I was
here accosted by an old man, who asked me, &ldquo;if I should
like to feel the bridge shake?&rdquo;&nbsp; As I answered in the
affirmative, he desired me to place my back against the side over
the centre arch, and striking the opposite parapet rather heavily
with his own, a tremulous motion was distinctly felt; on this
account it is called the Shaking Bridge.&nbsp; It was built in
1636, from a plan of the celebrated Inigo Jones, and cost
&pound;1000, which was defrayed by the counties of Denbighshire
and Carnarvonshire, which it unites.</p>
<h3>LLANRWST</h3>
<p>is built upon the Denbighshire side of the river.&nbsp; The
Three Eagles is the most commodious inn in the town; and, being
rather fatigued, I threw my limbs upon a sofa, and resigned
myself to the drowsy god, first taking especial care to order a
substantial repast to be in readiness for me on my return from
the land of Nod.&nbsp; My last waking recollection was the words
of Mr. Lover&rsquo;s favourite song,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no use at all in my going to
bed,<br />
For its dhrames and not sleep, that comes into my
head.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dreams, however, did not picture my slumbers, and I awoke to
the unrivalled delight of a weary and hungry traveller&mdash;an
excellent hot dinner.</p>
<p><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>The
following morning I employed in paying my respects to the
different gentlemen to whom I had letters, and in gaining what
information I could respecting the objects most worthy of notice
in the town and surrounding neighbourhood.</p>
<p>The church and chapel adjoining were the first subjects to
engage my attention.&nbsp; In the former there is nothing
interesting, excepting an oaken screen, exquisitely carved, which
was taken from the Abbey of Maenan, the gallery for the singers
being above it.&nbsp; On the opposite side is the</p>
<h3>GWYDIR CHAPEL.</h3>
<p>This beautiful structure was erected in the year 1633, by Sir
Richard Wynne, of Gwydir, from a design of Inigo Jones, and was
for many years the burial place of the illustrious family of
Gwydir.&nbsp; At the sides of the chapel, fixed in panels of
wood, are several engravings on brass, illustrative of the
personages who are interred below; and in the east corner is a
tablet of white marble, containing the following remarkable
pedigree, comprising a period of 500 years.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This chapel was erected <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1633, by Sir Richard Wynne, of
Gwydir, in the county of Carnarvon, Knight and Baronet; Treasurer
to the High and Mighty Princess Henrietta Maria, Queen of
England, Daughter of Henry the Fourth, King of France, and wife
to our Sovereign Lord King Charles; where lieth buried his father
Sir John Wynne, of Gwydir, Knight and <a name="page112"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 112</span>Baronet, son and heir to Morris
Wynne, son and heir to John Wynne, son and heir to Meredith
Wynne, which three lie buried in the church of Dolwyddelen, with
tombs over them.&nbsp; This Meredith was son and heir to Evan,
son and heir to Robert, son and heir to Meredith, son and heir to
Howell, son and heir to David, son and heir to Griffith, son and
heir to Cradock, son and heir to Roderick, Lord of Anglesea, son
to Owen Gwynneth, Prince of Wales, and younger brother to David,
Prince of Wales who married Emma Plantagenet, sister to King
Henry the Second.&nbsp; There succeeded this David three princes;
his nephew Leolinus Magnus, who married Joan, daughter to King
John,&mdash;David, his son, nephew to King Henry the
Third,&mdash;and Llewelyn the last Prince of Wales of that house
and line, who lived in King Edward the First&rsquo;s time.&nbsp;
Sir John Wynne married Sydney, who lyeth buried here, daughter of
Sir William Gerrard, Knight, Lord Chancellor of Ireland, by whom
he had issue, Sir John Wynne, who died at Lucca, in Italy, Sir
Richard Wynne, now living, Thomas Wynne, who lyeth here, Owen
Wynne, now living, Robert Wynne, who lyeth here, Roger Wynne, who
lyeth here, William Wynne, now living, Maurice Wynne, now living,
Ellis Wynne, who lyeth buried at Whitford, in the County of
Flint, Henry Wynne, now living, Roger Wynne, who lyeth here, and
two daughters, Mary, now living, married to Sir Roger Mostyn, in
the County of Flint, Knight, and Elizabeth, now living, married
to <a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>Sir
John Bodville, in the County of Carnarvon, Knight.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Beneath this is a superb engraving of Dame Sarah Wynne, one of
the daughters of the old Chevalier Sir Thomas Myddelton, of Chirk
Castle, and wife of the above-mentioned Sir Richard Wynne; she
died June 16th, 1671.&nbsp; This piece of engraving was executed
by one William Vaughan, in a style of elegance hardly to be met
with, and may be justly reckoned among the first productions of
the age in which he lived.</p>
<p>On the south side are two stately pyramidal columns of
variegated marble, decorated with martial insignia; one to the
memory of Meredith Wynne, the other to Sir John Wynne and Sydney
his wife; on their pedestals are Latin inscriptions on black
marble which have been thus translated:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;To the Memory of Meredith Wynne, a
descendant of Owen Gwynedd, Prince of Wales, who under happy
auspices, founded the House of Gwydir, removed and endowed the

of March, 1525.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Between the above monuments is a small tablet of <a
name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>white
marble to the memory of John Wynne ab Meredith with a Latin
inscription to the following effect:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;John Wynne ab

an inheritor of his Father&rsquo;s virtues, a just and pious<br
/>
man, to whom Euna, his wife, brought five<br />
sons and two daughters.&nbsp; He died<br />
the 9th of July, 1559.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the floor is a stone effigy in armour, with the feet
resting on a lion couchant, of Howel Coetmore ap Gruffydd Vychan
ap Dafydd Gam, alias G&ocirc;ch, natural son to David, Prince of
Wales, from whose descendants according to tradition, Gwydir was
purchased by the Wynnes.</p>
<p>Near to the effigy of Howel Coetmore is the under-part of a
stone coffin in which Llewelyn ab Iorwerth, surnamed the Great,
the son-in-law of King John, was buried at the Abbey of Conwy; to
the coffin is fixed a piece of brass with this
inscription:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;This is the
coffin of Leolinus Magnus, Prince<br />
of Wales, who was buried at the Abbey of<br />
Conwy, which upon the dissolution<br />
was removed thence.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On going from the chapel to the church, you pass over a large
square flag of free stone, having on its sides a Latin
inscription thus translated:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;To the Memory of the Sons of John Wynne of
Gwydir, Knight and Baronet, who died during their father&rsquo;s
life time; John, Knight, was buried at Lucca, in the free State
of Italy, in the year of his age 30, of our <a

</blockquote>
<p>In the chancel, between the reading desk and the communion
table, is a flag of free stone on the remains of Margaret
Vaughan, heiress of Caergai; she was esteemed the Sappho of her
age; many of her poetical productions are still extant.</p>
<p>The gallery over the reading desk is said to have been removed
here from the Abbey of Aberllechog, or Maenan Abbey, upon the
dissolution of that religious house.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Under the reading desk in the Church, in a pew belonging to
Kyffdy, is a Latin epitaph to the memory of Griffith Lloyd, of
Bruniog, Rector of this parish; this is said to have been written
by himself, and has been much admired for its singularity: it
runs thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Once
the undeserving School-master,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the more undeserving
Lecturer,<br />
And last of all, the most undeserving Rector of this Parish.<br

Do not think, speak, or write any thing evil of the
dead.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a Market Hall, Town Hall, Free Schools, and Alms
Houses.&nbsp; The latter were erected by Sir John Wynne, in 1610,
and received the name of Jesus Hospital.&nbsp; He endowed them
for the reception of twelve poor men, by ceding the rectorial
tithes of Eglwys V&acirc;ch, which are valued at &pound;200 per
annum.&nbsp; Within a mile of Llanrwst there is a spring, which
is much <a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span>esteemed for its healthful qualities.&nbsp; The water
is soft, and a drop of sal-volatile mixed with a cup of it turns
it white as milk, while oil of tartar causes it to assume a pearl
colour.&nbsp; If during the tourist&rsquo;s visit to Llanrwst
there should chance to fall much rain, I would advise him by all
means to view the cataract called</p>
<h3>RHAIADR Y PARC MAWR,</h3>
<p>in the valley of Nant Bwlch yr Haiarn, near Gwydir, but
otherwise the minuteness of the stream occasions no extraordinary
effect from this fall, which is about one hundred feet in
height.&nbsp; The chief object of interest, however, in this
vicinity, is the celebrated lake, called</p>
<h3>LLYN GEIRIONYDD,</h3>
<p>upon the borders of which once lived the chief of the Welsh
bards, Taliesin.&nbsp; At the eastern side of the lake is a
mound, upon the summit of which there is a kind of hollow, and in
it are the remains of an ancient edifice, which was probably the
residence of Taliesin, in the reign of Maelgwn Gwynedd, King of
Britain.&nbsp; Taliesin when an infant was found by Prince Elphin
by the side of a wear belonging to his father, Gwyddno Garanhir,
Lord of Cantrev Gwaelod.&nbsp; The Prince fostered the infant,
and had it liberally educated; and, at a proper age, introduced
him to the court of his father, Gwyddno.&nbsp; Upon this
occasion, Taliesin presented the king with a poem, the subject of
which was his own history, and another to the prince, which he
called <a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
117</span>Dyhuddiant Elphin, or the consolation of Elphin, a
translation of which is in Evan&rsquo;s Specimens of Welsh
Poetry.&nbsp; Taliesin had an opportunity of being serviceable to
his benefactor; for once, when the Prince was imprisoned by his
uncle, Maelgwn, in the castle of Dyganwy, the magic of his muse
effected his release.&nbsp; This celebrated bard was the
preceptor of Merddin ab Morvryn, and to him the lovers of poetry
are indebted for five new metres, while the historian and
antiquary are equally benefited by his accurate description of
the manners and customs of the Ancient Britons.</p>
<p>I quitted Llanrwst on the following morning, and took the road
to Conwy; two miles and a half brought me to the pretty village
of</p>
<h3>TREVRIW,</h3>
<p>which presents an animated scene.&nbsp; It is situated upon
the banks of the beautiful river Conwy, which is navigable up to
this point for vessels of fifty tons burthen, that supply the
town and neighbourhood with coals, lime, groceries, &amp;c.,
&amp;c., and return laden with slate, supplied from the adjacent
mines and quarries.&nbsp; A number of small boats, called
coracles, used by the fishermen, are seen studding the delightful
stream, while the larger vessels, towed against the wind or
sailing before it, present a pleasing picture.&nbsp; From this
place to Conwy there is nothing particularly to attract
attention, until you arrive within a mile of <a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>that
celebrated town, when, from the brow of a hill, is obtained a
view of the venerable fortress erected by the first Edward, and
the strongly fortified walls, completely encompassing the town,
and strengthened by massive towers.&nbsp; They are coeval with
the castle, and are built in the form of a Welsh harp, like those
of Carnarvon; but here there are no environs, and the town
presents the same appearance as when the chivalric monarch first
fortified it.</p>
<h3>CONWY.</h3>
<p>The town derives its name from Cyn (chief) and Wy river.</p>
<p>The principal inn is the Castle, which affords every
accommodation the traveller can desire.&nbsp; The Wynnes are
celebrated here, as in all parts of North Wales.&nbsp; In the
interior of the town stands Pl&acirc;s Mawr, which was erected in
1585, and is still a remarkable structure; its founder was Robert
Wynne, of Gwydir, the uncle of Sir John Wynne, the
historian.&nbsp; Over the grand entrance is inscribed, in Greek
characters &ldquo;<i>bear and forbear</i>,&rdquo; over which in
Roman characters, &ldquo;J. H. S. X. P. S.&rdquo; (Jesus Hominum
Salvator et Populi Salus.)&nbsp; The Old College is in Castle
Street, and the Church is built from the remains of the ancient
Cistercian Abbey, which was founded here by Llewelyn ab Iorwerth,
1185.&nbsp; It contains a rich baptismal font of gothic
structure, with a tablet to the memory of Nicholas Hookes, of the
town of Conwy, who was the <a name="page119"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 119</span>forty-first child of William and
Alice Hookes, and who was himself the father of twenty-seven
children.</p>
<p>During my short stay in Conwy, I endeavoured to discover the
best view of the town, which, I think, is from the eastern side
of the river, about midway between the chain bridge and the
mansion of Dyganwy.&nbsp; Nothing can be more interesting.&nbsp;
The variety of small craft, sailing and anchored, before its
warlike screen; the castle, with its towers and turrets, rising
in hostile grandeur upon its rocky base; the bridges, and lovely
scenery beyond of purple hills and thriving villages; and the
bright waters sporting with the luxuriant foliage of its woody
margin, create a sensation of delight in the pursuer of
picturesque scenery which he has probably seldom before
experienced.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p119b.jpg">
<img alt=
"Conwy Castle"

"Conwy Castle"
 src="images/p119s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Another delightful view may be obtained by ascending the rock
which overhangs the lodge of the suspension bridge upon its
eastern side.&nbsp; This very beautiful specimen of art has
however lost a great portion of its attraction since the
completion of the more wonderful structure of the Tubular Bridge,
which, like a mighty conqueror, looks proudly conscious of its
own importance, and compels the former to take a secondary
position in the estimation of the visitor.&nbsp; It consists of
only one span of 400 feet, and two abutments of masonry, which
are in perfect harmony with the venerable appearance of the
Castle.&nbsp; But the chief object of interest is the Castle,
which surpasses in picturesque grandeur any building of the kind
I ever beheld.&nbsp; I thought Carnarvon <a
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>Castle the
most beautiful of ruins, but it is not, in my opinion, to be
compared with Conwy.&nbsp; The solidity of its structure, and its
expansive site, resembling the fortresses of Syria and the Holy
Land, give to its exterior all that the most romantic imagination
could desire.&nbsp; Its foundation is a rock of slate, and its
works are impregnable.&nbsp; Nothing but famine could, at the
time it was erected, have had power to subdue it.&nbsp; Its walls
are from ten to twelve feet in thickness, and it had formerly a
deep and broad moat, on the west and north-west sides; which,
with the sea washing its base on the east and south, formed
insurmountable barriers to the assailants.</p>
<p>It was evening when I first entered this noble ruin.&nbsp; The
porteress very ungraciously left me to my meditations after
admitting me, locking the gate after her, and leaving me like a
state prisoner in the royal fortress.&nbsp; I confess I was
little pleased with the manners of my conductress, and the
solitary situation in which I was placed, and sensations arose
within me like those which a school boy feels when passing a
churchyard at midnight.&nbsp; The sun had set, and the deep
shadows of eve were darkening into night, as I stood alone in the
court yard, and flitting visions arose before me of those who had
crossed its space in distant by-gone ages&mdash;&ldquo;the plumed
troops,&rdquo; and courtly dames, and all the glitter of the
olden times.&nbsp; As I thus stood amongst the ruins, a deep
drawn sigh, close by my ear, made my heart leap <a
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>into my
throat, as I turned to discover from whence it proceeded.&nbsp;
But all was solitude around.&nbsp; The huge festoons of ivy,
unruffled by a breath of air hung in funereal grandeur on the
walls.&nbsp; As I passed into what had been the banqueting hall,
the darkness increased.&nbsp; It was a noble apartment, and
measured 130 feet in length, and thirty in breadth, in height
twenty.&nbsp; Nine windows looked southward, up the river, and
two into the courtyard.&nbsp; In the recesses were stone seats,
capable of accommodating twelve persons; and, as I seated myself
in one of these, my delusion of other days came over me.&nbsp;
Here sat the first Edward, the hero of Palestine; here was the
monarch besieged, and almost reduced by famine; here Hotspur and
King Richard held a conference; and the latter, putting himself
into the power of Northumberland, was betrayed by him, and sent a
prisoner to the usurper, Bolingbroke.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Life&rsquo;s but a walking shadow&mdash;a
poor player,<br />
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,<br />
And then is heard no more!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I made this apt quotation, another deep and heavy sigh, and
a rustling in the ivy, startled me, and the bird of solitude, the
lonely owl, flapped his heavy wings, and flew past me to a
remoter corner of the ruined hall.&nbsp; I arose, and walked to a
small chamber, where there was an open ornamented casement, and
which, as I was afterwards informed, bears the name of the
Queen&rsquo;s Oriel; from which there is a pleasant prospect of
part of the ruin and scenery beyond.</p>
<p><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>I
then proceeded to the terrace, at the south-western extremity,
which is on the surface of the rock, and the prospect from this
spot, interesting at all times, is doubly so by moonlight.&nbsp;
The suspension and tubular bridges beneath, the ocean on the
left, and this fertile valley on the right, with the sparkling
Conwy meandering through it, compose a scene of unexampled
beauty.</p>
<p>In the year 1290, when Edward was engaged in a dispute with
the King of France, and was determined to revenge himself upon
that potentate, in order to obtain supplies, he made the
experiment of taxing his newly-acquired Welsh subjects; which
they resented by hanging Roger de Pulesdon, who had been
appointed to collect the tax; and by defeating the English
forces, who attempted to enforce them.&nbsp; Alarmed at a revolt,
which was now rising into importance, and which threatened to
wrest from him his new dominions, Edward entered North Wales, to
conduct the war in person.&nbsp; Having proceeded in his march to
Conwy, he crossed that arm of the sea with a part of his forces,
and retiring into the castle with them, awaited the arrival of
the remainder.&nbsp; In his passage he lost many waggons, and
other carriages loaded with provisions, which were intercepted by
the Welsh, who came down in multitudes from the mountains, and
invested the castle upon the land side, while a sudden rise in
the Conwy, which prevented his troops from crossing the river and
rendering him assistance, <a name="page123"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 123</span>made his situation extremely
alarming.&nbsp; He was surrounded by water and the enemy, cut off
from his army, and threatened with famine.&nbsp; The good fortune
of Edward, however, returned to him in the hour of need.&nbsp;
The river subsided, and his forces being able to cross to his
relief, the Welsh again retired to the mountains, and the English
monarch passed his Christmas holidays without interruption at the
castle.</p>
<p>In 1665, the Earl of Conwy, under pretence of its being for
his majesty&rsquo;s service, stripped the castle of all its
furniture, iron, and lead, and shipped them off to Ireland,
otherwise it might have remained as firm and entire at the
present day, as when it was first erected.&nbsp; If these Goths
were aware of the ignominy they attached to their shields by acts
so disgraceful, they might perhaps have permitted beauty and
grandeur to remain undefiled by their sacrilegious touch.</p>
<p>The young men still keep up many of the ancient local customs;
amongst which, on Nos Calanmai, or, the eve of the first of May,
they hang on the houses of their sweethearts bunches of rosemary
and ribbons.</p>
<p>At the door of a prude they tie a penglog, or part of a
horse&rsquo;s skeleton.&nbsp; There is likewise a custom
preserved called Stocsio.&nbsp; Upon Easter Sunday, a great
number of boys and men assemble on Pentwthil, with wands of
gorse, to proclaim the laws and regulations which are to be
observed upon the following morning.&nbsp; The last married
person is sought to perform this office, who, mounted on a heap
of stones, issues his mandate, <a name="page124"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 124</span>while the rest listen with silent
attention.&nbsp; He decrees that all men under sixty years of age
are to appear in the street before six o&rsquo;clock on the
following morning; and all under forty, before four; and all
under twenty are commanded not to go to bed at all, under penalty
of being put into the stocks.&nbsp; The orator then descends,
amidst loud cheering, and the assembled parties separate; the
younger branches to form plans of amusement, and the graver to
secure their carts, waggons, and wheelbarrows, with chains and
locks, to prevent their being seized upon the following day; a
very necessary precaution, as every vehicle, unchained, or
otherwise unsecured, is sure of being pressed before dawn of day
into the service of the light-hearted youths, who are not over
careful of their neighbours&rsquo; property during the uproarious
period of their festivity.&nbsp; Early in the morning, the stocks
are placed at one end of the street, and a party, marching to the
inspiring music of a drum and fife, parade the town, in order to
convey to the place of punishment all seceders from this ancient
law of custom.&nbsp; When they arrive at a house where a rebel
resides, the storming party endeavour, by all practicable means,
to gain admittance; such as climbing in at the windows, forcing
open the back door, &amp;c., and they generally secure the
culprit; who, if he be caught in bed, is allowed sufficient time
to dress himself, and then hurried away to the stocks, amid the
exulting shouts of the assembled multitude.&nbsp; His feet being
secured, one of the party gives him <a name="page125"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 125</span>a severe lecture upon the sin of
idleness, and of breaking old established customs.&nbsp; Then
taking his right hand, he puts questions to him; such as, whether
he would rather kiss the mistress or the maid?&mdash;whether he
prefers buttermilk or strong ale?&mdash;and the more satisfactory
his answers are to the party, the more thickly his hand is
plastered with mud, until at length he is released, and with loud
cheering, permitted to join the forces, as they march off in
search of another rebel.</p>
<p>There is a pearl fishery at Conwy, and many poor families are
supported by gathering the muscles which contain these
gems.&nbsp; The fish is called by Linn&aelig;us <i>mya
margaritifera</i>.&nbsp; The produce is transmitted to London in
the pure natural state, and easily finds a market amongst the
jewellers, who purchase them by weight, but in the neighbourhood
of Conwy the purposes they are appropriated to are unknown.&nbsp;
It was my good fortune to meet with a brother tourist at the
Castle Inn; who after acquainting me with the above facts,
offered to conduct me in the morning to Llandudno, which offer I
thankfully accepted; and, before the sun had finished his draught
of mountain dew, we had crossed the bridge, and were pursuing our
course to the appointed spot.&nbsp; The tide was at low ebb, and
a pleasant walk of three-quarters of a mile upon the hard sand
brought us to</p>
<h3><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>DINAS GONWY,</h3>
<p>&ldquo;The fort of the Conwy.&rdquo;&nbsp; By the English, it
is called the Gannoc, and by the common people in the
neighbourhood &ldquo;Y Vaer dre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ruins of an ancient castle are to be seen at a short
distance, situated upon two hillocks, near the shore.&nbsp; From
thence we crossed by Eglwys Rh&ocirc;s, where Maelgwn Gwynedd is
said to have taken refuge to avoid the yellow fever, which was
committing great havoc in all parts of Europe.&nbsp; Gloddaeth,
the residence of the Hon. Lloyd Mostyn, is sweetly situated near
this place.&nbsp; It was built by his ancestors in the reign of
Elizabeth, and is celebrated for the Welsh manuscripts contained
in the library, now removed to Mostyn.&nbsp; The grounds are most
tastefully laid out, and the tourist will find himself amply
rewarded for his pains while viewing the extreme beauty of the
scenes around.</p>
<h3>LLANDUDNO</h3>
<p>Is built at the foot of a huge mass of rock which projects
into the sea, called the Great Orme&rsquo;s Head.&nbsp; The old
church is dedicated to St. Tudno, who lived in the beginning of
the sixth century.&nbsp; There is a curious old screen in the
church of great antiquity: it is made of wood, and supposed to
have been brought from the chapel at Gogarth.</p>
<p>On an eminence above the village is Dinas, which, as its name
implies, was a fortified post of the Ancient Britons.&nbsp; A
wall of great thickness encircles the <a name="page127"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 127</span>summit of the hill, and within the
area are great numbers of hollow circles, edged with stones about
twelve feet in diameter.&nbsp; This fortification is exactly
similar to that on Conwy town mountain, on Penmaen Mawr, and in
many other places; and it answered the same purpose: not for a
constant residence, but only as a place of refuge on the approach
of an enemy.</p>
<p>Near this place is a <i>maen sigl</i>, or rocking stone,
called <i>Cryd Tudno</i>, or St. Tudno&rsquo;s Cradle.&nbsp; It
is an immense stone, which is so equally poised that a very
slight degree of pressure will enable a person to put it in
motion.</p>
<p>The greater part of the inhabitants of Llandudno derive their
livelihood from the copper mines, which have been carried on in
every direction.&nbsp; The discovery of rude implements in old
closed up shafts, such as hammers of stone, and chisels of bones
thoroughly impregnated with copper, is an evidence of their
having been worked at a very remote period.</p>
<p>This village has become, within the last few years, a
favourite resort for sea-bathing, and is rapidly increasing in
population and importance.</p>
<p>We arrived at the Castle, in Conwy, greatly fatigued, and
equally delighted with our day&rsquo;s journey.&nbsp; The
following morning we proceeded by railway to Bangor.</p>

<h3>BANGOR.</h3>
<p>This town derives its name from Ban Cor, which means the high
choir.</p>
<p>We stopped at the Penrhyn Arms, a most commodious inn, which
is capable, it is said, of making up one hundred beds
nightly.&nbsp; It occupies a commanding situation, and from the
back premises embraces a noble prospect;&mdash;the Straits, the
Shore of Anglesey, the Bay of Beaumaris, Penrhyn Castle, Puffin
Island, Penmaen Mawr, and the Great Orme&rsquo;s Head, with the
ocean in the distance.</p>
<p>There are other excellent inns in the town, namely the Castle,
the Liverpool Arms, and the Albion; the <a
name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>latter is
extremely comfortable, and the landlord civil and obliging, as I
most willingly testify from experience.&nbsp; There is no place
in Wales so well calculated for a tourist to make his head
quarters as Bangor.&nbsp; The various spots he may visit by
appropriating a day to each, would supply him with gratification
for a month at least.</p>
<p>Near the spot where the London road branches off from the
Chester, is the grand entrance to Penrhyn Castle, the property of
Col. the Hon. D. Pennant, M.P.&nbsp; The lodge is a beautiful
specimen of substantial architecture; it is protected by a
corresponding gateway, massive and imposing.&nbsp; The park wall
extends circularly seven miles, and is thirteen feet high.&nbsp;
To describe the magnificence of the interior of the castle I feel
would prove a vain effort, and I earnestly recommend all tourists
who take this route not to quit the neighbourhood without seeing
it, or they will be reproached for slighting one of the grandest
treats old Cambria can afford them.</p>
<h3>THE CATHEDRAL</h3>
<p>Was founded by Maelgwn Gwynedd, King of Wales, of whom I have
had occasion to speak before, as the patron of Taliesin, the
celebrated Welsh bard.</p>
<p>The original edifice, which was erected in 525, was destroyed
in 1071, and rebuilt shortly after, but was again reduced to
ruins by Owen Glyndwr, and for ninety years was neglected, until
Bishop Dean restored <a name="page130"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 130</span>the choir, and the body of the tower
was rebuilt by Bishop Skeffington, in 1532, which still remains
in a perfect state of preservation.&nbsp; The free school was
founded in 1557, by Dr. Jeffrey Glynn, upon the site of an
ancient parish church, built by King Edgar, within about 400
yards of the present cathedral, and is considered an excellent
preparatory seminary for Oxford and Cambridge.</p>
<p>The remains of an ancient castle, built by Hugh Lupus, Earl of
Chester, in the reign of Henry the Second, are still visible upon
a rock opposite to the free school, and some pieces of scoria,
found on the spot, lead us to suppose arrows were manufactured
there.&nbsp; At the back of the Friar&rsquo;s School is another
hill, and on the top of it are the remains of a British
encampment.</p>
<p>The town, within the last twenty years, has been extended to
nearly four times its original magnitude, and possesses an
appearance of cleanliness particularly gratifying.</p>
<p>The great lions of Bangor are the Menai and Britannia Tubular
Bridges.</p>
<h3>THE MENAI BRIDGE.</h3>
<p>The principal opening between the supporting pillars is 560
feet in breadth, through which the vessels pass with all their
canvas set, without the least danger of their masts touching the
overhanging bridge.&nbsp; There are four stone arches upon the
Anglesey side, and three upon the Carnarvon, which complete the
roadway, and <a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>have each a span of fifty feet.&nbsp; The length of the
bridge is 800 feet, and its height is 100 feet above the surface
of the Menai at high water.&nbsp; The weight of the bridge and
its suspending chains, between the pyramids is six hundred and
thirty-nine tons, nineteen hundred and nine pounds; and that of
the iron work from one extremity of the chains to the other is
estimated at 2130 tons, 1800 consisting of wrought, and three
hundred and thirty of cast iron.</p>
<p>The first stone of this astonishing work was laid by W. A.
Provis, Esq., on the 10th August, 1820; and on the 20th April,
1825, the first main chain was thrown across the strait.&nbsp;
This important step being completed, three of the workmen, in the
height of their enthusiasm, ventured to walk along the chain from
pier to pier; and a cobbler no less daring and enthusiastic,
seated himself in the centre of the curve, and, while suspended
at the fearful height, with sky above and the deep water of the
strait gliding beneath him, drove the last sparable into one of
those convenient comforts called clogs.</p>
<p>The view from the centre of the bridge beggars
description.&nbsp; Waving woods, barren precipices, distant
mountains, Bangor, and Beaumaris, Penrhyn Castle, Penmaen Mawr,
the Great Orme&rsquo;s Head, the ocean, and the strait, are
objects that dazzle and astonish from the exquisite beauty of
their natural arrangement.</p>
<p><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>But
even this, the noblest specimen of hanging bridges in the world,
is eclipsed by the monster</p>
<h3>BRITANNIA TUBULAR BRIDGE,</h3>
<p>which crosses the Straits about a mile above it on the
Carnarvonshire side.&nbsp; Fully to appreciate this monster work
of human ingenuity, the traveller should ascend the Britannia
Tower, which rises from a rock in the centre of the Straits, and
gaze upon the glorious panorama which surrounds him.&nbsp; Upon
the Carnarvonshire side he will behold the mountains of Snowdonia
veiling their lofty summits in the clouds.&nbsp; Along their
sides, and through their mighty bulks, the railroad train now
rolls its dragon form, shaking their rocky ribs, and awakening
their echoes in its swift and thundering course; beneath him are
the Menai Straits, through which the imprisoned waters of the
Irish Sea and St. George&rsquo;s Channel vibrate everlastingly
backwards and forwards, at the same time successively rise and
fall, occasioning an endless succession of aqueous changes.&nbsp;
Upon the shores of Anglesey a rich and fertile country studded
with villas, surrounded by luxuriant woods, and waving corn,
presents itself, forming a pleasing contrast to the wild grandeur
of the Snowdon Hills, and exhibiting an example of the perfection
of cultivation, cheerful labour, and undisturbed
tranquillity.</p>
<p>It was originally intended to carry the Chester and Holyhead
line across the Suspension Bridge, and to detach the trains at
each end of the bridge, leaving the <a name="page133"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 133</span>carriages to be drawn over by
horses, but the government objected to this arrangement,
considering that it would be proved to be a public
inconvenience.&nbsp; A bridge of two cast iron arches, to be
supported on piers of masonry, was next proposed: this second
project was objected to by the masters of the Carnarvon harbour,
upon the plea that it would seriously interfere with the
navigation of the Straits.&nbsp; At length Mr. Robert Stephenson
offered to construct a mode of transit which should entirely do
away with all objections.&nbsp; He had come to the conclusion
that a tube, or tunnel of wrought iron, sufficiently large for
the passage of trains, would be the most plausible plan, as it
would neither endanger the navigation nor cause any delay to the
railway carriages in crossing over the Straits.&nbsp; His plan
was adopted, and the stupendous work of art which now awakens the
astonishment of the beholder, will bear the name of Stephenson
down to remote posterity, attached as it is to one of the
brightest ornaments of the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>From Bangor the traveller can proceed by rail to</p>
<h3>CARNARVON,</h3>
<p>which is one of the best towns in North Wales, the transit is
performed in less than half an hour, and he will reap unqualified
pleasure by examining the numerous interesting objects which
render that celebrated place so remarkable.</p>
<p>The present town of Carnarvon is sprung from the <a
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>ruins of
the ancient Roman city of Segontium, which name the Welsh had
changed into the apt one of Caer yn Arvon, or the Fortress in
Arvon, the district bordering on M&ocirc;n, the Welsh name for
Anglesey.&nbsp; The site, which for the natural strength of its
position, was admirably chosen by our first Edward, is bounded on
the one side by the Menai, and by the estuary of the Seiont on
the other, and on the third and part of the fourth by the creek
of the Menai.</p>
<p>The castle is the chief object of attraction, and excites the
admiration of all who gaze upon its time-worn but majestic
walls.&nbsp; The entrance to it is beneath a huge tower, upon the
front of which is carved the statue of Edward, the founder, who
grasps his dagger as if menacing his newly acquired and most
unwilling subjects.&nbsp; Unlike the towers of Conwy Castle,
which are round, those of Carnavon are polygonal, hexagonal, and
octagonal, and the tourist should notice especially the Eagle
Tower, which is the loftiest of them all, and which at one time
possessed a double interest, created by the popular belief that
Edward the Second was born within its walls; unfortunately,
however, there are records in the national archives which prove
that the Eagle Tower was not finished until that unhappy monarch
was thirty years of age.</p>
<p>The castle covers about two and a half acres of ground, and
forms an oblong irregular square.&nbsp; The walls, which are at
present exactly in the same state as they were in the time of
Edward, are defended by <a name="page135"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 135</span>thirteen great towers, the masonry
of which is about seven feet nine inches in thickness, and have
within them a series of galleries with narrow &oelig;illets or
slips for the discharge of arrows.&nbsp; The walls of the Eagle
Tower are about nine feet six inches in thickness, and the view
from its summit, of the Menai and Anglesey on the one side, and
Snowdonia on the other, is extremely fine.&nbsp; The mutilated
eagle upon the tower is supposed to be Roman, and that Edward
found it at Old Segontium.</p>
<p>Near the steep bank of the Seiont, at a short distance from
the castle are rather extensive remains of an ancient Roman fort,
which, it would seem, was intended to secure a landing place in
the event of an attack.&nbsp; A little above this, and about a
quarter of a mile from the Menai, is the site of the ancient
Roman station Segontium, of which some fragments of a wall are
the only visible remains, but underground the relics are more
numerous; at the depth of a few feet occur foundations of
buildings, broken pottery, ashes, and so forth&mdash;while
numerous coins (some of them gold) and other Roman remains have,
at various times, been exhumed.&nbsp; According to Mathew of
Westminster, Constantius, the father of Constantine the Great,
was interred here, and the same historian further asserts that
Edward found the body and caused it to be honourably buried in
the Church (it is supposed) of St. Publicius, or Llanbeblig.</p>
<p>Having gratified his curiosity, the traveller may once <a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>more take
the rails for Bangor, and, accompanied by pleasing visions of
past greatness, return to his inn well satisfied with his
day&rsquo;s excursion.</p>
<p>After remaining three days in this interesting neighbourhood,
I took my departure from Bangor towards Chester.&nbsp; The
tourist who may be inclined to follow my track, and has
sufficient time to spare, should leave the train at</p>
<h3>RHYL,</h3>
<p>A pretty watering place at the termination of the beautiful
Vale of Clwyd, and near the mouth of the river from which it
derives its name.&nbsp; The town is neat, and is yearly
increasing in importance.&nbsp; From hence the visitor will
obtain a view of the Great Orme&rsquo;s Head, the Puffin Island,
and the wide expanse of the Irish Sea.&nbsp; The sands are
extensive, and admirably adapted for sea bathing; the hotels are
both commodious and excellent.</p>
<p>I may mention that Rhuddlan, St. Asaph, and Denbigh, are
within easy distance from Rhyl, and will afford a pleasant
day&rsquo;s excursion.&nbsp; Quitting Rhyl, a short ride conveys
the traveller to</p>
<h3>HOLYWELL,</h3>
<p>So celebrated for its miraculous spring.&nbsp; The church of
this place is dedicated to Saint Winefred, and stands at the foot
of a steep hill, but it is so far removed from the upper town
that the bells cannot be <a name="page137"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 137</span>heard by the people above, for which
reason a very ancient custom is continued, namely, a ringer is
employed to go about the town with a large bell slung around his
shoulder, and a cushion fastened to his knees, against which the
bell beats as he walks, to summon the inhabitants to the house of
prayer; but the chief object of interest to visitors in this town
is St. Winefred&rsquo;s Well, from which it takes its name of
Holywell.&nbsp; The Roman Catholic clergymen of ancient days,
knew well how to impose on the credulity of the ignorant laymen,
when they were desirous of enriching their establishments, as
well perhaps as they do at the present period, and for this
purpose they invented amongst other absurd fallacies the
ridiculous fable of St. Winefred, which is carved upon a pendant
projection over the fountain, with the arms of England at the
bottom.</p>
<h3>ST. WINEFRED.</h3>
<p>The legend is told thus:&mdash;Winefred was a beautiful and
devout virgin, of noble birth, and it is supposed lived in the
early part of the seventh century, under the guardianship of her
uncle, the good Bueno, who had founded a church here, and was
conspicuous for his great piety.&nbsp; A young prince of the
country, of the name of Caradoc, saw the damsel, and was
enamoured with the beauty of her person, and resolved to attempt
her virtue; seizing an opportunity, when all but the fair
Winefred were at prayers, he declared to her his passion.&nbsp;
She fled from his presence, but before <a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>she could
reach the sacred edifice, which stood at the foot of the hill,
even, as at the present day, the prince overtook her, and in a
paroxysm of rage and disappointment, he struck off her head,
which bounded down the hill, through the door of the church, to
the foot of the altar.&nbsp; Bueno raised up the head, and
instead of a pool of blood, which appeared for a moment, a
fountain of clear water gushed forth.&nbsp; His horror was great,
when he found that the beautiful features, and golden hair of the
head he gazed upon, were those of his beloved niece.&nbsp; The
saint, for such Bueno afterwards became, took up the head, and
with devout prayers, joined it to the body, and to the wonder of
all present it immediately re-united, the place of separation
being marked only by a white line encircling the neck.&nbsp; The
cruel Prince Caradoc fell dead on the spot where he had committed
the atrocious act.&nbsp; Winefred lived fifteen years after this
event, and founded a nunnery at Gwytherin, Denbighshire, of which
she became abbess, and died there.</p>
<p>The well is an oblong square, about twelve feet by seven, and
the water passes into a small square court, through an arch under
which, it is said, the Roman Catholics used to swim as an act of
penance.&nbsp; Innumerable are the miracles said to have been
performed through the intervention of the saint, and as countless
is the list of devotees who have paid their homage at her holy
shrine, standing up to their chins in the water, and pouring
forth their prayers for hours together.</p>
<p><a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>Putting aside all superstitious notions, the waters of
the well possess many sanative properties.&nbsp; Katherine of
Arragon, the wife of Henry the Eighth, was a benefactress to this
building, and here her arms appear, viz.: three pomegranates in a
shield surmounted by a crown, the badge of the House of
Grenada.&nbsp; Isabel, Countess of Warwick, left to St. Winefred,
in 1439, her gown of russet velvet.&nbsp; In the church there is
a bell which was christened in honour of the saint, and at the
ceremony a string of virgins took hold of the rope, bestowed a
name upon the bell, whilst the priest sprinkling holy water
baptised it, and put it into petticoats; after which the ladies
gave a grand feast, and made great presents, which the priests
received on behalf of the bell.</p>
<p>There are several good inns in the town, the principal ones
are the White Horse, the King&rsquo;s Arms, the King&rsquo;s
Head, and the Red Lion.&nbsp; About a mile eastward of Holywell,
situated in a beautiful meadow, are the ruins of Basingwerk
Abbey, formerly a building of considerable importance.&nbsp; It
is surrounded by groves of tall trees, and commands a fine view
of the Cheshire shore.&nbsp; The next place on the Chester line
of railway, to which the traveller should direct his attention,
is</p>
<h3>FLINT,</h3>
<p>At which place his historical recollections will be awakened
by the ancient castle, which is situated upon a rock in the marsh
at the bottom of the town.</p>
<p>The castle is a square building, with a large round tower at
three of the corners, and a fourth a little disjoined <a
name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>from the
others, and much larger than the rest.&nbsp; This is called the
double tower.&nbsp; It was formerly joined to the castle by a
drawbridge, and is of great thickness.&nbsp; Here the unfortunate
Edward the Second received from exile his imperious favourite
Piers Gaveston, and here it was that the equally unfortunate
Richard the Second was betrayed by the Earl of Northumberland
into the power of Bolingbroke.&nbsp; Northumberland had met
Richard at Conwy, to which place he had retired after his return
from Ireland, and they were journeying together when, amid the
recesses of the mountains, near Penmaen Rh&ocirc;s, the king
descried a large body of soldiers with the Percy banners.&nbsp;
The unhappy monarch attempted to escape, but Northumberland
seizing the bridle of his horse, compelled him to proceed towards
Rhuddlan Castle, where they dined, and in the evening conducted
him to Flint.&nbsp; Upon the following morning Richard was
astonished by the appearance of a numerous army, commanded by
Bolingbroke, in full march along the sands, which speedily
surrounded the castle.&nbsp; Richard descended from the keep to
meet his rival, who fell upon his knees, and for a short time
assumed a respectful appearance, but he soon discarded the mask,
and &ldquo;with a high sharp voice,&rdquo; says Stowe,
&ldquo;badde bring forth the king&rsquo;s horses; and then two
little naggs, not worth fortie franks, were brought forthe.&nbsp;
The king was set on the one, and the Earl of Salisbury on the
other, and thus the duke brought them from Flint to
Chester.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span>HAWARDEN</h3>
<p>Is six miles from Flint, and lying two miles on the right of
the Queen&rsquo;s Ferry Station; it is a neat and comfortable
town, consisting of one street of about half a mile in length,
and wears a cheerful aspect.&nbsp; The Glynne Arms will receive
the visitor, and afford him every attention and comfort he can
possibly desire.&nbsp; Hawarden Park is one of the most
picturesque and beautiful domains in the principality.&nbsp; Its
lofty trees and velvet grass, its swelling knolls and solitary
glens, cannot fail to awaken the most pleasing emotions in the
breast of the tourist, while the ivy-clad ruins of the ancient
castle give a solemnity and grandeur to the scene indescribably
interesting.&nbsp; In the year 1280 a general insurrection took
place among the Welsh, under their prince, Llewelyn, and his
brother David, for the recovery of their liberties and ancient
form of government.&nbsp; It was commenced by David, on the 22nd
of March, Palm Sunday, in a stormy night, which favoured his
design so well, that he surprised this castle, put the garrison
to the sword, and took Roger De Clifford, the Justiciary of
Chester, prisoner.&nbsp; After the death of Llewelyn, and the
subjugation of Wales, he suffered for this in a most exemplary
manner, being condemned to four species of punishment, viz., to
be drawn by a horse to the place of execution as a traitor to the
king who had made him a knight; to be hanged for murdering Fulk
Trigald, and other knights, in this fortress; for his sacrilege
in committing those murders on Palm <a name="page142"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 142</span>Sunday, his bowels were to be burnt,
and finally his body was to be quartered and hung in different
parts of the kingdom, because he had in different parts conspired
the death of the king.&nbsp; In 1495 this castle belonged to
Margaret, Countess of Richmond, the mother of Henry the Seventh,
and that monarch honoured it with his presence for some time, in
order that he might here enjoy the pleasures of the chase.&nbsp;
During the civil wars it suffered the usual vicissitudes of
fortune.&nbsp; It was besieged in 1643 by the King&rsquo;s
troops, when it was garrisoned by one hundred and twenty men of
Sir Thomas Myddelton&rsquo;s regiment.</p>
<p>The remains of the castle consist of a fine circular tower, or
keep, situated upon the summit of a mount, a few walls, and the
foundations of some rooms.&nbsp; On all sides it was surrounded
by deep chasms and fosses, and from its extensive plan and broad
foundations it has the appearance of having been erected at
different periods.&nbsp; The modern mansion of Hawarden Park
belongs to Sir S. R. Glynne, Baronet, a member of parliament, and
lord-lieutenant of Flintshire.&nbsp; It is a stately structure,
with antique-looking windows and turrets, and commands a view of
the city of Chester and the entire course of the silvery Dee from
that station to the Irish Channel.&nbsp; Leaving this most
interesting and lovely place, and casting many a lingering look
behind, I once more reached the railway station, and after a
short ride of seven miles, arrived at the far-famed city of</p>
<h3><a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
143</span>CHESTER.</h3>
<p>This city still bears marks of its Roman origin.&nbsp; The
laying out of the streets is Roman; the two principal
thoroughfares crossing at right angles in the centre of the
city.&nbsp; Its fortifications are reasonably supposed to be on a
Roman basis.&nbsp; Remains of Roman masonry have been discovered,
and the usual vestiges of the Romans have, at different times,
been turned up&mdash;such as coins, fibul&aelig;, inscribed
tiles, stones, and altars.&nbsp; In 1653 a votive altar to
Jupiter was dug up, which had been raised by an officer of the
twentieth legion, called the Victorious.&nbsp; In fact, the city
was named in honour of this legion, Legecestria; and after the
Romans ceased to occupy it, the Britons called it Caer Lleon vawr
ar Ddyvrdwy: or, &ldquo;the camp of the great Legion on the
Dee.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the time of the Romans Chester was the
termination of the celebrated Watling Street, the great military
road which extended from Dover across the island.</p>
<p>It was in this city that the Welsh, in the year 1300,
acknowledged the sovereignty of the English, the homage of the
freeholders being received by the infant Prince of Wales,
afterwards Edward the Second.&nbsp; In the year 1506, Chester was
afflicted with that remarkable disease the sweating sickness,
which carried off ninety-one householders in three days; and a
few years afterwards made such ravages that the streets of the
city were overgrown with grass.</p>
<p><a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>In
1558, a circumstance occurred in Chester which was of the
greatest importance to the Protestants of those days.&nbsp; Dr.
Henry Cole, Dean of St. Paul&rsquo;s, is said to have been
entrusted with the commission issued by Mary to empower the Lord
Deputy of Ireland to prosecute those who refused to observe the
ceremonies of the Roman Catholic religion.&nbsp; The Doctor, on
his way to Ireland, stopped at Chester, and having put up at the
Blue Posts Inn, in Bridge Street, was visited by the Mayor, to
whom he communicated the business in which he was engaged:
opening his cloak bag, he took out a leathern box, observing,
with exultation, &ldquo;he had that within it, which would lash
the heretics of Ireland.&rdquo;&nbsp; The hostess, Mrs. Elizabeth
Mottershead, overheard this by accident, and, having a brother in
Ireland, who was a Protestant, she became alarmed for his safety,
and took the opportunity, while the Doctor was attending the
Mayor down stairs, to open the box, take out the commission, and
leave in its place a pack of cards, with the knave of clubs
uppermost.&nbsp; The Dean arrived in Ireland on the 7th of
December, 1558.&nbsp; Being introduced to the Lord-Deputy
Fitzwalter and the Privy Council, he explained the nature of his
embassy at greater length, and then presented the box,
containing, as he thought, the commission.&nbsp; His Lordship
took it, and, having opened it, beheld, with considerable
surprise, the pack of cards with the knave on the top.&nbsp; The
Doctor was thunderstruck; and, in much confusion, said that he
certainly had a commission, and that <a name="page145"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 145</span>some artful person must have made
the exchange.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said his Lordship,
&ldquo;you have nothing to do but to return to London, and get it
renewed: meanwhile we will shuffle the cards.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
Doctor was obliged to follow this unwelcome advice, but before he
could reach Ireland a second time the Queen died, and her
sanguinary commission became useless.&nbsp; The woman, whose
presence of mind and dexterity had thus providentially
interposed, was rewarded by Elizabeth with a pension of forty
pounds a year.</p>
<p>During the civil war in the reign of Charles the First,
Chester stood several sieges, which lasted about three
years.&nbsp; The inhabitants, who had sided with the king,
endured great privations, but at last, when the siege was
converted into a blockade, they surrendered on honourable terms
to the parliamentary army.&nbsp; The city is situated on a dry
rock above the stream of the Dee, which flows round it on two
sides.&nbsp; The neighbouring district is a rich but level plain,
presenting, however, some interesting views from the ancient
walls of the town, which form one among the many remarkable
features of Chester.&nbsp; These walls, which are now used as a
healthful and favourite promenade, are especially interesting, as
being the only perfect military work of the kind remaining in
England, and the circuit of them is somewhat more than a mile and
three quarters.&nbsp; They command many interesting prospects,
and amongst them may be mentioned the views towards the forest
hills, from the eastern point, towards North <a
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>Wales and
the Dee from the opposite side, and a fine view of the bridge and
the river, with the surrounding country, from the south-east
angle.&nbsp; At the sides of the walls are the remains of several
ancient towers, and at the north-east angle is one which bears
the name of the Ph&oelig;nix Tower, remarkable from the
circumstance of Charles the First having witnessed a part of the
battle of Rowton Heath, from its leads, in 1645.</p>
<p>The four principal gates of the city are the terminations of
the four principal streets, named respectively Eastgate Street,
Northgate Street, Bridge Street, and Foregate Street.&nbsp; These
four streets, as described by Pennant, are excavated and sunk
many feet beneath the surface.&nbsp; The carriages are driven far
below the level of the kitchens, on a line with ranges of shops,
over which, on each side of the streets, passengers may walk from
end to end, secure from wet or heat, in galleries, (or
<i>rows</i>, as they are called,) purloined from the first floor
of each house, open in front, and balustraded.&nbsp; The back
courts of all these houses are level with the rows, but to go
into any of these four streets it is necessary to descend a
flight of several steps: the rows certainly form the most
remarkable peculiarity of Chester, and the opinion of Mr. Ormerod
is that they were first erected as galleries from which the
citizens might defend themselves against those sudden inroads of
armed cavalry, to which they were so much exposed in ancient
times, in consequence of their position on the frontier of the
English and Welsh.</p>
<p><a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>The
most remarkable feature of Chester is its Cathedral, which was
founded within the site of the Benedictine Abbey of St.
Werburgh.&nbsp; It is a spacious irregular building, composed of
the red sandstone of the country, and was built, or rather
rebuilt, during the reigns of Henry the Sixth, Seventh, and
Eighth.&nbsp; In the cloisters, and buildings adjacent, occur
some interesting specimens of Norman architecture, and the early
decorations of the pointed style.&nbsp; The western front, and
some other detached parts, exhibit equally beautiful specimens of
the enriched Gothic, and the space occupied by the entire range
of the conventual buildings furnishes a magnificent idea of the
grandeur of the establishment.</p>
<p>The old Norman castle was removed in 1790, to make room for
the modern castle, which is, indeed, a noble structure, and
contains the county courts, the gaol, the barracks, and the
armoury.&nbsp; The citizens of Chester were formerly as
celebrated as those of Coventry for their dramatic performances,
founded chiefly on scripture history.&nbsp; They are attributed
to one Randall, a monk of Chester Abbey, and are said to have
been first performed between 1268 and 1273.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>My task is done, and I must now quit this lovely
land&mdash;never perhaps to see it more.&nbsp; But let me hope
the sketches I have given of its various charms will induce
others to take the path which I have pursued with so much
pleasure.&nbsp; It leads through the most interesting <a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>portion of
the country.&nbsp; For the artist, there is an inexhaustible
store of beauty.&nbsp; The geologist and mineralogist will find
the lore they thirst for, in almost every hill and valley,
through which they pass.&nbsp; The smoke-dried citizen may have
the London <i>blacks</i> blown from his garments by the healthful
mountain breeze, and drink huge draughts of the pure air until he
feels intoxicated with pleasure, while he is enabled to supply
himself cheaply with a valuable stock of delightful recollections
that will enable him, at any time, to raise a visionary paradise
around him&mdash;to banish painful thoughts; for, in fine, pain
must give place to pleasure, gloom to sunshine, and sickness to
invigorating health, in the enchanting principality of <span

Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
